<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE present work, like its predecessor, "The
Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783,"
is wholly a result of the author's connection
with the United States Naval War College as lecturer
upon Naval History and Naval Tactics.</p>

<p>When first asked to undertake that duty, the
question naturally arose how to impart to the subject
of Naval History an aspect which, in this very
utilitarian age, should not be open to the ready
reproach of having merely archæological interest,
and possessing no practical value for men called
upon to use the changed materials of modern naval
war. "You won't have much to say about history,"
was then the somewhat discouraging comment of a
senior officer of his own service.</p>

<p>In pondering this matter, it occurred to the author—whose
acquaintance with naval history was at
that time wholly superficial—that the part played
by navies, and by maritime power generally, as a
factor in the results of history, and as shaping the
destinies of nations and of the world, had received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
little or no particular attention. If this were so,
an analysis of the course of events through a series
of years, directed to show the influence of Sea Power
upon History, would at least serve to imbue his
hearers with an exalted sense of the mission of their
calling; and might also, by throwing light upon the
political bearings of naval force, contribute to give
the service and the country a more definite impression
of the necessity to provide a fleet adequate to
great undertakings, lest, if an occasion should arise
for what he has ventured to call "statesmanship
directing arms," we should be found unprepared,
through having no sufficient armed force to direct.</p>

<p>In avowing this as the original, and, for a time at
least, almost the sole motive of his work, the author
practically confesses that he at the beginning had no
scientific appreciation or reasoned knowledge of the
naval history of the past. Upon giving this the attention
required by his new duties, and collating the
various incidents with the teachings of recognized
authorities upon land warfare, he soon came to recognize
that the principles which they claimed to be of
general application in their own specialty received
also ample and convincing illustration in naval annals;
although the development of the Art of War
at sea has been slower, and is now less advanced,
than on shore. This backward result has been due,
partly, to uncertainties peculiar to the sea, and partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
to a contempt for the study of the past, and of its
experience, as "not practical," from which the naval
profession has not yet wholly rid itself.</p>

<p>Thus, in its course, the author's former work,
without abandoning its first simple motive, expanded
into an attempt to analyze the strategic
conduct of the naval campaigns, as well as the tactical
features of the various battles—all too few—in
which any clear tactical purpose was shown by
the commanders engaged. The cordial reception
given to the work by his professional brethren, in
Great Britain as well as at home, has been to him
not only most gratifying, but wholly unexpected.
Its chief significance is, however, not personal. The
somewhat surprised satisfaction testified is virtually
an admission that, in the race for material and mechanical
development, sea-officers as a class have
allowed their attention to be unduly diverted from
the systematic study of the Conduct of War, which
is their peculiar and main concern. For, if the commendation
bestowed be at all deserved, it is to
be ascribed simply to the fact that the author has
been led to give to the most important part of the
profession an attention which it is in the power
of any other officer to bestow, but which too few
actually do.</p>

<p>That the author has done so is due, wholly and
exclusively, to the Naval War College, which was instituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
to promote such studies. If further success
attend his present venture, it is his hope that this
avowal may help to assure the long uncertain fortunes
of the College, to which,—and to its founder,
Rear-Admiral Stephen B. Luce,—he gratefully acknowledges
his indebtedness for guiding him into
a path he would not himself have found.</p>

<p>The term of this work is fixed at the year 1812;
a date signalized by Napoleon's invasion of Russia,
which wrecked his empire,—or at least gave the
outward and visible token of the wreck,—and also
by the outbreak of war between Great Britain and
the United States. To the latter, as a subject of
particular national interest, the author hopes in the
near future to devote a special study.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE ten years following the Peace of Versailles, September
3, 1783, coming between the two great wars
of American Independence and of the French Revolution,
seem like a time of stagnation. The muttering and heaving
which foretold the oncome of the later struggle were
indeed to be heard by those whose ears were open, long
before 1793. The opening events and violences which
marked the political revolution were of earlier date, and
war with Austria and Prussia began even in 1792; but the
year 1793 stands out with a peculiar prominence, marked
as it is by the murder of the king and queen, the beginning
of the Reign of Terror, and the outbreak of hostilities with
the great Sea Power, whose stubborn, relentless purpose
and mighty wealth were to exert the decisive influence
upon the result of the war. Untiring in sustaining with
her gold the poorer powers of the Continent against the
common enemy, dogged in bearing up alone the burden of
the war, when one by one her allies dropped away, the
year in which Great Britain, with her fleets, her commerce,
and her money, rose against the French republic, with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
conquering armies, its ruined navy, and its bankrupt treasury,
may well be taken as the beginning of that tremendous
strife which ended at Waterloo.</p>

<p>To the citizen of the United States, the war whose results
were summed up and sealed in the Treaty of Versailles
is a landmark of history surpassing all others in
interest and importance. His sympathies are stirred by
the sufferings of the many, his pride animated by the
noble constancy of the few whose names will be forever
identified with the birth-throes of his country. Yet in a
less degree this feeling may well be shared by a native of
Western Europe, though he have not the same vivid impression
of the strife, which, in so distant a land and on so
small a scale, brought a new nation to life. This indeed
was the <i>great</i> outcome of that war; but in its progress,
Europe, India, and the Sea had been the scenes of deeds of
arms far more dazzling and at times much nearer home
than the obscure contest in America. In dramatic effect
nothing has exceeded the three-years siege of Gibraltar,
teeming as it did with exciting interest, fluctuating hopes
and fears, triumphant expectation and bitter disappointment.
England from her shores saw gathered in the
Channel sixty-six French and Spanish ships-of-the-line,—a
force larger than had ever threatened her since the days of
the Great Armada, and before which her inferior numbers
had to fly, for the first time, to the shelter of her ports.
Rodney and Suffren had conducted sea campaigns, fought
sea fights, and won sea victories which stirred beyond the
common the hearts of men in their day, and which still
stand conspicuous in the story of either navy. In one respect
above all, this war was distinguished; in the development,
on both sides, of naval power. Never since the
days of De Ruyter and Tourville had so close a balance of
strength been seen upon the seas. Never since the Peace
of Versailles to our own day has there been such an approach
to equality between the parties to a sea war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The three maritime nations issued wearied from the
strife, as did also America; but the latter, though with
many difficulties still to meet, was vigorous in youth and
unfettered by bad political traditions. The colonists of
yesterday were thoroughly fitted to retrieve their own fortunes
and those of their country; to use the boundless resources
which Divine Providence had made ready to their
hands. It was quite otherwise with France and Spain;
while Great Britain, though untouched with the seeds of
decay that tainted her rivals, was weighed down with a
heavy feeling of overthrow, loss and humiliation, which for
the moment hid from her eyes the glory and wealth yet
within her reach. Colonial ambition was still at its loftiest
height among the nations of Europe, and she had lost
her greatest, most powerful colony. Not only the king
and the lords, but the mass of the people had set their
hearts upon keeping America. Men of all classes had predicted
ruin to the Empire if it parted with such a possession;
and now they had lost it, wrung from them after a
bitter struggle, in which their old enemies had overborne
them on the field they called their own, the Sea. The Sea
Power of Great Britain had been unequal to the task laid
upon it, and so America was gone. A less resolute people
might have lost hope.</p>

<p>If the triumph of France and Spain was proportionate to
their rival's loss, this was no true measure of their gains,
nor of the relative positions of the three in the years after
the war. American Independence profited neither France
nor Spain. The latter had indeed won back the Floridas
and Minorca; but she had utterly failed before Gibraltar,
and Jamaica had not even been attacked. Minorca, as
Nelson afterwards said, was always England's when she
wanted it. It belonged not to this power or that, but to
the nation that controlled the sea; so England retook it in
1798, when her fleets again entered the Mediterranean.
France had gained even less than Spain. Her trading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
posts in India had been restored; but they, even more than
Minorca, were defenceless unless in free communication
with and supported by the sea power of the mother-country.
In the West Indies she returned to Great Britain more
than the latter did to her. "France," says a French historian,
"had accomplished the duties of her providential
mission" (in freeing America); "her moral interests, the
interests of her glory and of her ideas were satisfied. The
interests of her material power had been badly defended
by her government; the only solid advantage she had obtained
was depriving England of Minorca, that curb on
Toulon, far more dangerous to us when in their hands than
is Gibraltar."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately at this moment France was far richer in
ideas, moral and political, and in renown, than in solid
power. The increasing embarrassment of the Treasury
forced her to stay her hand, and to yield to her rival terms
of peace utterly beyond what the seeming strength of either
side justified. The French navy had reaped glory in the
five years of war; not so much, nearly, as French writers
claim for it, but still it had done well, and the long contest
must have increased the efficiency of its officers along with
their growing experience. A little more time only was
wanted for France, allied to Spain, to gain lasting results
as well as passing fame. This time poverty refused
her.</p>

<p>Spain, as for centuries back, still depended for her income
almost wholly upon her treasure ships from America.
Always risked by war, this supply became more than
doubtful when the undisputed control of the sea passed to
an enemy. The policy of Spain, as to peace or war, was
therefore tied fast to that of France, without whose navy
her shipping lay at England's mercy; and, though the national
pride clung obstinately to its claim for Gibraltar, it
was forced to give way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Great Britain alone, after all her losses, rested on a solid
foundation of strength. The American contest by itself
had cost her nearly £100,000,000, and rather more than
that amount had during the war been added to the national
debt; but two years later this had ceased to increase, and
soon the income of the State was greater than the outgo.
Before the end of 1783, the second William Pitt, then a
young man of twenty-four, became prime minister. With
genius and aims specially fitted to the restorative duties of
a time of peace, the first of British finance ministers in the
opinion of Mr. Gladstone,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he bent his great powers to fostering
the commerce and wealth of the British people.
With firm but skilful hand he removed, as far as the
prejudices of the day would permit and in the face of much
opposition, the fetters, forged by a mistaken policy, that
hampered the trade of the Empire. Promoting the exchange
of goods with other nations, simplifying the collection
of taxes and the revenue, he added at once to the
wealth of the people and to the income of the State. Although
very small in amount, as compared with the enormous
figures of later years, the exports and imports of
Great Britain increased over fifty per cent between the
years 1784 and 1792. Even with the lately severed colonies
of North America the same rate of gain, as compared
with the trade before the war, held good; while with the
old enemy of his father and of England, with France, there
was concluded in 1786 a treaty of commerce which was
exceedingly liberal for those days, and will, it is said, bear
a favorable comparison with any former or subsequent
treaty between the two countries. "In the course of little
more than three years from Mr. Pitt's acceptance of office
as First Lord of the Treasury," says the eulogist of his distinguished
rival, Fox, "great commercial and financial reforms
had been effected.... The nation overcoming its
difficulties, and rising buoyant from depression, began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
rapidly to increase its wealth, to revive its spirit, and renew
its strength."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Such was the home condition of the British people; but
fully to appreciate the advantageous position to which it
was rising, in preparation for the great conflict still unforeseen,
it must be remembered that all things worked together
to centre and retain the political executive power in
the hands of Pitt. The feelings of the king, then a very
real force in the nation; the confidence of the people,
given to his father's son and fixed by the wisdom of his
own conduct and the growth of the moneyed prosperity so
dear to the British heart; the personal character of his
only rival in ability,—all combined to commit the political
guidance of the State to one man at the great crisis when
such unity of action was essential to strength. Whether
the great peace minister was equal to the wisest direction
of war has been questioned, and has been denied. Certainly
it was not the office he himself would have chosen; but it
was a great gain for England that she was at this time
able to give herself wholly to a single leader. He took
office with a minority of one hundred in the House of
Commons, held it for two months constantly out-voted, and
then dissolving Parliament appealed to the country. The
election gave him a majority of over a hundred,—a foretaste
of the unwavering support he received from the representatives
of the people during the early and critical
years of the French Revolution, when the yet fluid opinions
of the nation were gradually being cast and hardened into
that set conviction and determination characteristic of the
race.</p>

<p>How different the state of France is well known. The
hopeless embarrassment of the finances, hopeless at least
under the political and social conditions, the rapid succession
of ministers, each sinking deeper in entanglements,
the weak character of the king, the conflict of opinions, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
lack of sympathy between classes, all tending to the assembling
of the Notables in February, 1787, and the yet
more pregnant meeting of the States General, May 4, 1789,
which was the beginning of the end. France was moneyless
and leaderless.</p>

<p>But while the Western countries of Europe were by these
circumstances disposed or constrained to wish for the continuance
of peace, restlessness showed itself in other quarters
and in ways which, from the close relations of the
European States, disquieted the political atmosphere. The
Austrian Netherlands and Holland, Poland and Turkey,
the Black Sea and the Baltic, became the scene of diplomatic
intrigues and of conflicts, which, while they did not
involve the great Western Powers in actual war, caused
them anxiety and necessitated action.</p>

<p>The Empress-Queen of Austria and Hungary, Maria
Theresa, had died in 1780. Her son, the Emperor Joseph
II., came to the throne in the prime of life, and with his
head full of schemes for changing and bettering the condition
of his dominions. In 1781, the weakness of Holland
being plainly shown by her conduct of the war with Great
Britain, and the other countries having their hands too full
to interfere, he demanded and received the surrender of
the fortified towns in the Austrian Netherlands; which,
under the name of the "barrier towns," had been held and
garrisoned by Holland since the Peace of Utrecht in 1713,
as a bridle upon the ambition of France. At the same
time the circumstances of the great maritime contest,
which during the American Revolution covered all the seas
of Europe, impelled every neutral nation having a seaboard
to compete for the carrying trade. Holland for a time had
shared this profit with the nations of the North; but when
Great Britain, rightly or wrongly, forced her into war, the
trade which had been carried on through Holland and her
great rivers reaching into the heart of Germany, being
denied its natural channel, sought a new one through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Austrian Netherlands by the port of Ostend. The growth
of the latter, like that of Nassau during the Civil War in
the United States, was forced and unhealthy,—due not to
natural advantages but to morbid conditions; but it fostered
the already strong wish of the emperor for a sea
power which no other part of his dominions could give.</p>

<p>This movement of Belgian commerce was accelerated by
the disappearance of the British carrying trade. As in the
days of Louis XIV., before he had laid up his ships-of-the-line,
so in the American War the cruisers and privateers
of the allies, supported by the action of the combined fleets
occupying the British navy, preyed ravenously on British
shipping. In the days of the elder Pitt it had been said
that commerce was made to live and thrive by war; but
then the French great fleets had left the sea, and British
armed ships protected trade and oppressed the enemy's
cruisers. Between 1778 and 1783 Great Britain was fully
engaged on every sea, opposing the combined fleets and
protecting as far as she could her colonies. "This untoward
state of things reduced the English merchants to
difficulties and distresses, with respect to the means of
carrying on their trade, which they had never experienced
in any other war. Foreign vessels were used for the conveyance
of their goods, and the protection of a foreign flag
for the first time sought by Englishmen."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The writer
forgot the days of Jean Bart, Duguay-Trouin, and Forbin;
we may profitably note that like conditions lead to like
results.</p>

<p>Thus, while America was struggling for life, and the
contests of England, France, and Spain were heard in all
quarters of the world, Netherland ships showed abroad on
every sea the flag of an inland empire, and Ostend grew
merrily; but if the petty port and narrow limits thus
throve, how should the emperor bear to see the great city
of Antwerp, with its noble river and its proud commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
record, shut up from the sea as it had been since the Treaty
of Westphalia? His discontent was deep and instant;
but it was the misfortune of this prince that he took in
hand more than his own capacity and the extent of his
estates would let him complete. His attention being for
the moment diverted to southeastern Europe, where Austria
and Russia were then acting in diplomatic concert against
the Porte, the question of Antwerp was dropped. Before
it could be resumed, the Peace of Versailles had left Great
Britain, France, and Holland—all so vitally interested in
whatever concerned Belgium—free, though loath, to enter
into a new contention. Matters having been for the time
arranged with Turkey, the emperor again in 1784 renewed
his demands, alleging, after the manner of statesmen, several
collateral grievances, but on the main issue saying
roundly that "the entire and free navigation of the Scheldt
from Antwerp to the sea was a <i>sine qua non</i>" to any
agreement.</p>

<p>The arguments—commercial, political, or founded on
treaty—which were in this instance urged for or against
the natural claim of a country to use a river passing
through its own territory, to the sea that washes its shores,
are not here in question; but it is important to analyze the
far-reaching interests at stake, to note the bearing of this
dispute upon them and so upon the general diplomacy of
Europe, and thereby trace its intimate connection with
that Sea Power whose influence upon the course of history
at this period it is our aim to weigh. Though modified in
expression by passing events, and even at times superficially
reversed, like natural currents checked and dammed
by contrary winds, these underlying tendencies—being
dependent upon permanent causes—did not cease to exist
during the storm of the Revolution. Ever ready to resume
their course when the momentary opposition was removed,
the appreciation of them serves to explain apparent contradictions,
produced by the conflicts between transient necessity
and enduring interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>From that great centre of the world's commerce where
the Scheldt, the Meuse, the Rhine, and the Thames meet
in the North Sea, near the Straits of Dover, there then
parted two principal lines of trade passing through European
waters,—through seas, that is, along whose shores
were planted many different powers, foreign and possibly
hostile to each other. Of these two lines, one ended in the
Baltic; the other, after skirting the coasts of France and
the Spanish peninsula and running the gantlet of the
Barbary corsairs, ended in the Levant or Turkish Seas.
The great Empire of Russia, which only made itself felt in
the sphere of European politics after the Treaty of Utrecht,
in 1713, had since then been moving forward not only its
centre, which bore upon the continent of Europe, but also
both its wings; one of which touched and overshadowed
the Baltic on the North, while the other, through a steady
course of pressure and encroachment upon the Turks, had
now reached the Black Sea. This advance had been aided
by the fixedness with which France and England, through
their ancient rivalry and their colonial ambitions, had kept
their eyes set upon each other and beyond the Atlantic;
but the Peace of Versailles forced the combatants to pause,
and gave them time to see other interests, which had
been overlooked through the long series of wars waged,
between 1739 and 1783, over commerce and colonies. It
was then realized that not only had Russia, in the past
half-century, advanced her lines by the partition of Poland
and by taking from Sweden several provinces on the Baltic,
but also that she had so added to her influence upon the
Black Sea and over the Turkish Empire by successive
aggressions, wresting bits of territory and establishing
claims of interference in behalf of Turkish subjects, as to
make her practical supremacy in Eastern waters a possibility
of the future.</p>

<p>The Western Question, as it may fitly be called, had
been settled by the birth of a new nation, destined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
greatness and preponderance in the western hemisphere;
the Eastern Question, phrase now so familiar, soon loomed
on the horizon. Was it to receive a like solution? Was a
great nation, already close to the spot, to win a position of
exceptional advantage for dominating in eastern waters as
America must do in western? for it must be remembered
that, although the Levant was then only the end of a European
trade route, both the history of the past and the well
understood possibilities of the future pointed to it as one
of the greatest centres of commerce, and therefore of
human interest and political influence, in the world. The
Levant and Egypt had then, and still keep, the same interest
that is now being felt in the Isthmus of Panama and
the Caribbean; and it is hard to imagine a more threatening
condition of naval power than the possession of the
Black Sea and its impregnable entrance, by a vigorous
nation, so close to the Eastern highway of the world. The
position in 1783 was the more dangerous from the close
alliance and respective abilities of the rulers of Austria and
Russia; the cool-headed and experienced Catharine,
through her influence on her weaker colleague, directing
the resources of both empires in a path most favorable to
Russia.</p>

<p>The tendency of Russian growth, and the historic events
which marked its progress, were, of course, well enough
known in England long before; but there is a difference
between knowing facts and realizing their full meaning.
Circumstances alter cases; and men's minds, when
strongly bent one way, do not heed what is passing elsewhere.
Hence, in 1785, we find the attitude of Great
Britain toward Russia very different from that of fifteen
years earlier, when the empress and the Porte were at
war. In 1770, British officers commanded Russian fleets
and ships, and a British admiral had leave to take a
place in the Russian Admiralty, with the promise of his
home rank being restored to him. The Czarina sent a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
fleet of twenty sail-of-the-line from the Baltic to the Levant.
They stopped and refitted in Spithead; Russian
soldiers were landed and camped ashore to refresh themselves;
English sergeants of marines were employed to
drill them; a Russian eighty-gun ship, flying the flag
of an Anglo-Russian admiral, was docked in Portsmouth
and cut down to improve her sailing qualities. Thus
comforted and strengthened they sailed for the Mediterranean;
and, receiving further damage from the poor
seamanship of their crews, they were again fitted at Port
Mahon,—then an English dockyard,—for action in the
Levant.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
When, among the hard knocks of the two following
years, the Russians destroyed a Turkish fleet of
fifteen ships-of-the-line in a port of Asia Minor, British
lieutenants commanded the fire-ships, and a British commodore
the covering squadron.</p>

<p>To us now, with our remembrance of Kars and Silistria,
of the Crimea and Hobart Pasha, of Cyprus and Besika
Bay, these things seem like a dream; and the more so,
that the Mediterranean powers of the earlier day viewed
the Russian approach with ill-concealed mistrust, and laid
severe restrictions upon the use of their ports. But Turkey
then, though a good friend to Great Britain, was a
yet better friend to France; the Turkish alliance had
been useful to the latter country by making diversion in
her wars with Austria, Great Britain's natural ally; the
French were the favored nation by Turkish commercial
treaties, and a naval war in eastern waters could not but
be injurious to their commerce. Difficulties about trade
might even bring about a collision between France and
Russia, which at least could do no harm to Great Britain
at a time when her rival was known to be steadily building
up her navy with a view to revenge past defeats; just as
now she is thought to be looking for a day of reckoning
with Germany. The Baltic trade was also of immense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
value, and the friendship of Russia was necessary thereto.
Altogether, in 1770, the Russian nation, notwithstanding
the French leanings of the Czarina, was, upon the whole,
the friend of Great Britain's friends, and the opponent of
her enemies,—especially of the one traditional, or, as even
generous Englishmen used to say, the <i>natural</i> enemy,
France. Russia bore especially against Sweden, Poland,
and Turkey; and these it was the consistent aim of the
best school of French statesmen to court and strengthen.</p>

<p>But in 1785 a great change had taken place. The war
of 1770 had planted Russia firmly on the Black Sea. The
treaty of Kainardji in 1774 admitted her trade freely to
the Mediterranean,—a privilege which other trading nations,
in the narrow spirit of the day, considered their own
loss. Russian frigates had entered the Dardanelles on
their way to the Black Sea; and though the Porte, terrified
at the consequences of its action, stopped them at
Constantinople, the move was none the less significant.
Then there had come, in 1774, the partition of Poland,
universally condemned as unrighteous and dangerous to
the balance of power, though submitted to by the other
States. If Great Britain, though restless over this, saw
still some compensation in the injury done to France by
the weakening of her allies, and hugged herself with the
belief that her insular position made the continental balance
of less moment, she had had a severe reminder of
Russia's growing strength and power to injure, in the
Armed Neutrality of 1780. This unfriendly blow, aimed
by a State she had looked upon as almost a natural ally,
which she had so greatly helped but ten years before, and
which had now chosen the moment of her direst straits
to attack what she considered her maritime rights, probably
completed the alienation, and opened the eyes of British
statesmen to the new danger with which they were
threatened by the position of Russia upon the Baltic and
close to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>France, also, had little less interest than England in
this condition of things, and certainly felt no less. From
the days of Henry IV. and Colbert, and even before, she
had looked upon the Levant as peculiarly her own field,
the home of a faithful ally, and the seat of a lucrative
trade which was almost monopolized by her. Although
so far foiled in India, she had not yet lost her hopes of
overcoming and replacing the British hold upon that land
of fabled wealth, and she understood the important bearing
of the Levant and Egypt upon the security of tenure
there. It need not then surprise us, in the great maritime
war which we are approaching, to find Napoleon—for all
his greatness, the child of his generation—amid all the
glory and bewildering rush of his famous Italian campaign,
planning conquest in Egypt and the East, and Nelson, that
personification of the British sea power of his day, fighting
his two most brilliant battles in the Levant and in the
Baltic. Nor will we be unprepared to see an importance
equal to that of Gibraltar and Mahon in former days, now
attached to points like Malta, Corfu, Taranto, Brindisi, as
well as to Sicily and Egypt, by the statesmen, generals,
and admirals, whose counsels directed the military efforts
of the belligerents. Many of these points had heretofore
lain out of the field of action of the Western Powers, but
the rising Eastern Question was bringing them forward.</p>

<p>Nor was it in the Levant alone that questions vitally affecting
the rival States awaited solution. The trade interests
of the Baltic, as the outlet through which great rivers
and the products of immense regions found their way to
the world beyond, made its control also an object of importance
to both the chief parties in the coming struggle,—to
Great Britain who strove to drive her enemy off the
sea, and to France who wished to shut out hers from the
land. But, besides its commercial importance, the secluded
character of the sea, the difficulty of the approach,—aggravated
by the severe climate,—and the immense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
preponderance in strength of Russia over Sweden and
Denmark, made always possible an armed combination
such as that of 1780, which was in fact renewed in 1800,
seriously threatening the naval supremacy of Great Britain.
Such a coalition it was vital to the latter to prevent,
and most desirable to her enemy to effect. If formed, it
was a nucleus around which readily gathered all other
malcontents, dissatisfied with the harsh and overbearing
manner in which the great Sea Power enforced what she
considered her rights over neutral ships.</p>

<p>The nearness of England to the Baltic made it unnecessary
to have naval stations on the way for the repair or
shelter of her shipping, but it was most undesirable that
the ports and resources of Holland and Belgium, lying
close on the flank of the route, and doubly strong in the
formidable outworks of shoals and intricate navigation
with which nature had protected them, should be under
the control of a great hostile power. Jean Bart, and his
fellow-privateersmen of a hundred years before, had shown
the danger to British shipping from even the third-rate
port of Dunkirk, so situated. Where Dunkirk sent squadrons
of frigates, Antwerp could send fleets of ships-of-the-line.
The appearance of Russia, therefore, and her predominance
on the Baltic, made weightier still the interest
in the political condition of the Low Countries which, for
generations past, Great Britain had felt on account of her
commercial relations with them, and through them with
Germany; an interest hitherto aroused mainly by the
ambition of France to control their policy, if not actually
to possess herself of a large part of their territory. She
had to fear that which was realized under Napoleon,—the
conversion of Antwerp into a great naval station, with
free access to the sea, and the control of its resources and
those of the United Provinces by a strong and able enemy.</p>

<p>Great Britain, therefore, had in 1781 seen with just
apprehension the aggressive attitude of Joseph II. toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the Dutch, and the fall of the "barrier towns." It is true
that these fortresses had ceased to afford much protection
to Holland, owing to her military decline, but the event
emphasized her exposure to France; while the power of
Austria to defend her own provinces, or the Dutch, was
notoriously less than that of France to attack, owing to
the relative distance of the two from the scene, and the
danger to troops, on the march from Austria, of being assailed
in flank from the French frontier. Now, again, in
1784, she was forced to look with anxiety—less on account
of Austria than of France—upon this raising of the
question of the Scheldt. There was little cause to fear
Austria becoming a great sea power now, when she had
held the Netherlands three fourths of a century without
becoming such; but there was good reason to dread that
the movements in progress might result in increasing her
rival's sea power and influence—perhaps even her territory—in
the Low Countries. All these things did come
to pass, though not under the dying monarchy.</p>

<p>It may be presumed that the wise Catharine of Russia,
without in the least foreseeing the approaching French
convulsion which shook her plans as well as those of other
European rulers, realized the true relations between her
country and the Western powers, when she so heartily supported
the emperor in his claim for the free navigation of
the Scheldt. There was no likelihood then, as there is
little likelihood now, that Great Britain and France would
act together in the Eastern Question, then too new to outweigh
former prejudices or to unite old enemies. If the
contention of Austria were successful, Russia would secure
a friendly port in a region naturally hostile to her
pretensions. If unsuccessful, as things then looked, the
result would probably be the extension of French influence
in the Netherlands and in the United Provinces; and
French gain there meant gain of sea power, with proportionate
loss of the same to Great Britain. The empress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
could still reckon on their mutual antagonism; while the
British navy, and the way in which it was used in war,
were more serious dangers to Russia than the French
armies. Whatever her reasoning, there is no doubt that
at this time her policy was drawing closer to France.
The French ministers in the East mediated between her
and the Sultan in the unceasing disputes arising from the
treaty of Kainardji. A commercial treaty on most favorable
terms was concluded with France, while that with
Great Britain was allowed to lapse, and its renewal was
refused during many years.</p>

<p>Such were the ambitions and the weighty solicitudes,
well understood on all hands, which, during the eight
years succeeding the emperor's demand for the opening
of the Scheldt, underlay and guided the main tendencies
of European policy, and continued so to do during the
revolutionary wars. The separate events which group
themselves round these leading outlines, up to the outbreak
of war in 1793, can only be hastily sketched.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the close family relationship between
Louis XVI. and the emperor, the French government
looked coldly upon the latter's action in the matter of the
Scheldt. The long-standing struggle in the United Provinces
between partisans of Great Britain and France was
just now marked by the preponderance of the latter, and,
consequently, of French influence. As Austria seemed resolved
to enforce her claims by war, the king first offered
his mediation, and, when that was unavailing, told the
emperor he would interpose by arms. His troops were
accordingly massed on the Belgian frontier. It was understood
that the king of Prussia, who was brother-in-law
to the stadtholder, would act with France. Russia, on the
other hand, proclaimed her intention to support Austria.
Sweden, as the enemy of Russia, began to put ships in
commission and enlist soldiers; while from Constantinople
came a report that, if war began, the sultan also would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
improve so good an opportunity of regaining what he had
lately lost. While the quarrel about the Scheldt was thus
causing complications in all quarters, an incident occurred
upon the chief scene of trouble, which under such conditions
might well have precipitated a general war. An
Austrian brig was ordered to sail from Antwerp to the
sea, to test the intentions of Holland. Upon passing the
boundary she was fired upon and brought to by a Dutch
armed ship. This happened on the 8th of October, 1784.</p>

<p>Yet after all war did not come, owing to Joseph's volatile
attention being again drawn from the matter immediately
in hand. He proposed to the elector of Bavaria to take
the Netherlands in exchange for his electorate. This
transfer, which by concentrating the possessions of Austria
would greatly have increased her weight in the Empire,
was resisted by the whole Germanic body with Frederic
the Great at its head. It therefore came to naught; but
the slackening of the emperor's interest in his Scheldt
scheme promoted, under French auspices, a peaceful arrangement;
which, while involving mutual concessions,
left the real question substantially untouched. Its solution
was not reached until the storm of the Revolution swept
city and river into the arms of the French republic. This
compromise was shortly followed by a treaty of the closest
alliance between France and the United Provinces, engaging
them to mutual support in case of war, fixing the
amount of armed ships or men to be furnished, and promising
the most intimate co-operation in their dealings with
other States. This agreement, which, as far as compacts
could, established French preponderance in the councils of
Holland, was ratified on Christmas Day, 1785.</p>

<p>This treaty gave rise to serious and regretful consideration
in Great Britain; but the growing financial embarrassment
and internal disturbance of France were rapidly
neutralizing her external exertions. The following years
were marked by new combinations and alliances among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
States. In 1786 Frederic the Great's death took away an
important element in European politics. The quarrel between
the two factions in Holland had reached the verge
of civil war, when an insult offered by the French party to
the wife of the stadtholder, sister to the new king of Prussia,
led to an armed interference by this sovereign. In
October, 1787, Prussian troops occupied Amsterdam and
restored to the stadtholder privileges that had been taken
from him. Even France had strongly condemned the act
of those who had arrested the princess, and advised ample
satisfaction to be given; but, nevertheless, when the French
party appealed for aid against the Prussian intervention,
she prepared to give it and notified her purpose to Great
Britain. The latter, glad again to assert her own influence,
replied that she could not remain a quiet spectator,
issued immediate orders for augmenting her forces by sea
and land, and contracted with Hesse for the supply of
twelve thousand troops upon demand. The rapid success
of the Prussians prevented any collision; but Great Britain
had the gratification, and France the mortification, of seeing
re-established the party favorable to the former.</p>

<p>In February, 1787, the Assembly of Notables, which had
not met since 1626, was opened by Louis XVI. at Versailles.
But the most striking event of this year was the
declaration of war against Russia by Turkey, which determined
no longer to wait until its enemy was ready before
engaging in an inevitable conflict. The Turkish manifesto
was sent forth August 24; Russia replied on the 13th of
September.</p>

<p>The emperor, as the ally of Russia, declared war against
Turkey on the 10th of February, 1788. Operations were
carried on by the Austrians around Belgrade and on the
Danube. The Russians, bent on extending their power on
the Black Sea, invested Oczakow at the mouth and on the
right bank of the Dnieper,—Kinburn on the left side having
already been ceded to them by the treaty of Kainardji.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
The czarina also decided to renew in the Mediterranean
the diversion of 1770, again sending ships from the Baltic.
When the distance and inconvenience of this operation,
combined with the entire lack of any naval station in the
Mediterranean, are considered in connection with the close
proximity of Russia to that sea in mere miles, there will
be felt most forcibly her tantalizing position with reference
to commerce and sea power, to whose importance she has
been keenly alive and to which she has ever aspired since
the days of Peter the Great. It is difficult to understand
how Russia can be quiet until she has secured an access
to the sea not dependent upon the good-will of any other
State.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the many causes of displeasure she had
given to Great Britain, Catharine went on with her arrangements
as though assured of the good-will and help
before received. Pilot boats were engaged to meet the
ships in British waters, and take them to British dockyards.
Under her orders, British merchants chartered
eighteen large ships to convey artillery and stores after the
fleet. All these arrangements were quietly frustrated by
Pitt's ministry, which forbade seamen to serve in any foreign
ships; and, upon the ground that the nation was to
be strictly neutral, made the contractors renounce their
engagements. Catharine then turned to Holland, which
also refused aid, pleading the same purpose of neutrality.
This concert of action between the two maritime States
forced Russia to abandon so distant an expedition and illustrated
the advantage she would have obtained from the
emperor's claim to the Scheldt. It was at this time that
the celebrated Paul Jones, who had distinguished himself
by his desperate courage in the American Revolutionary
War, took service in the Russian Navy and was given a
high command; but his appointment so offended the
British officers already serving in the fleet, whom their
government had foreborne to recall, that they at once resigned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
The Russians could not afford to lose so many
capable men, and Jones was transferred from the Baltic to
the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Soon a fourth State took part in the contest. On the
21st of June, 1788, Sweden advanced her troops into Russian
Finland, and on the 30th war against her was declared
by Russia. It now proved fortunate for the latter that she
had not been able to get her fleet away from the Baltic.
The fighting on land was there mainly confined to the
north coast of the Gulf of Finland, while in the waters of
the Gulf several very severe actions took place. These
battles were fought not only between ships-of-the-line of
the usual type, but by large flotillas of gunboats and galleys,
and were attended with a loss of life unusual in naval
actions.</p>

<p>War being now in full swing throughout the East, Great
Britain and Prussia drew together in a defensive treaty, and
were joined by Holland also, under the new lease of power
of the stadtholder and British party. The quota of troops
or ships to be furnished in case of need by each State was
stipulated. The allies soon had occasion to act in favor of
one of the belligerents. Denmark, the hereditary enemy
of Sweden, and now in alliance with Russia, took this opportunity
to invade the former country from Norway, then
attached to the Danish crown. On September 24, 1788,
twelve thousand Danish troops crossed the frontier and
advanced upon Gottenburg, which was on the point of surrendering
when the sudden and unexpected arrival of the
king, in person and alone, prevented. There was not,
however, force enough to save the town, had not Great
Britain and Prussia interfered. The British minister at
Copenhagen passed over hastily into Gottenburg, induced
the Swedish king to accept the mediation of the two governments,
and then notified the Danish commander that,
if the invasion of Sweden was not stopped, Denmark would
be by them attacked. The peremptory tone held by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
minister swept away the flimsy pretext that the Danish
corps was only an auxiliary, furnished to Russia in accordance
with existing treaty, and therefore really a Russian
force. There was nothing left for Denmark but to recede;
an armistice was signed at once and a month later her
troops were withdrawn.</p>

<p>The true significance of the alliance between the two
Western Powers, to which Holland was accessory, is
markedly shown by this action, which, while ostensibly
friendly to Sweden, was really hostile to Russia and a diversion
in favor of the sultan. Great Britain and Prussia,
in consequence of the growing strength and influence of
Russia in the Baltic, the Black Sea, and the Continent,
and to check her progress, followed what was then considered
to be the natural policy of France, induced by ties
and traditions long antedating the existing state of things
in Europe. Sweden then, and Turkey later, traditional
allies of France, and in so far in the opposite scale of the
balance from Great Britain, were to be supported by the
demonstration—and if need were by the employment—of
force. This was done, not because France was as yet
less dreaded, but because Russia had become so much more
formidable. It was again the coming Eastern Question in
which, from the very distance of the central scene of action
from Western Europe, and from the character of the interests
and of the strategic points involved, Sea Power, represented
chiefly by the maritime strength and colonial
expansion of Great Britain, was to play the leading and
most decisive part. It was the dawning of the day, whose
noon the nineteenth century has not yet seen, during which
Nelson and Napoleon, Mohammed Ali and Ibrahim Pasha,
the Sultan Mahmoud and the Czar Nicholas, Napier, Stopford,
and Lalande in 1840, the heroes of Kars, Silistria,
and the Crimea, and of the Russo-Turkish war of 1877,
were to play their parts upon the scene.</p>

<p>But in the years after the Peace of Versailles this was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
new question, upon which opinions were unformed. It
was true that, to quote from a contemporary writer, "England
had had full leisure to ruminate upon, and sufficient
cause to reprobate, that absurd and blind policy, under the
influence of which she had drawn an uncertain ally, and
an ever-to-be-suspected friend, from the bottom of the Bothnic
Gulf to establish a new naval empire in the Mediterranean
and Archipelago."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These meditations had not
been fruitless, as was seen by the consistent attitude of
Pitt's ministry at this time; but on the other hand, when
it was proposed in 1791 to increase the naval force in commission,
in order "to add weight to the representations"
<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
being made by the allies to the belligerents,—in order, in
other words, to support Turkey by an armed demonstration,—Fox,
the leader of the Whigs, said that "an alliance
with Russia appeared to him the most natural and advantageous
that we could possibly form;"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> while Burke, than
whom no man had a juster reputation for political wisdom,
observed that "the considering the Turkish Empire as any
part of the balance of power in Europe was new. The principles
of alliance and the doctrines drawn from thence were
entirely new. Russia was our natural ally and the most useful
ally we had in a commercial sense."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> That these distinguished
members of the opposition represented the feelings
of many supporters of the ministry was shown by a diminished
majority, 93, in the vote that followed. The opposition,
thus encouraged, then introduced a series of resolutions,
the gist of which lay in these words: "The interests of
Great Britain are not likely to be affected by the progress
of the Russian arms on the borders of the Black Sea."
<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
In the vote on this, the minister's majority again fell to
eighty, despite the arguments of those who asserted that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
"the possession of Oczakow by the empress would facilitate
not only the acquisition of Constantinople, but of all lower
Egypt and Alexandria; which would give to Russia the
supremacy in the Mediterranean, and render her a formidable
rival to us both as a maritime and commercial power."
After making every allowance for party spirit, it is evident
that British feeling was only slowly turning into the channels
in which it has since run so strongly.</p>

<p>France, under the pressure of her inward troubles, was
debarred from taking part with her old allies in the East,
and withdrew more and more from all outward action. On
the 8th of August, 1788, the king fixed the 1st of May,
1789, as the day for the meeting of the States General;
and in November the Notables met for the second time, to
consider the constitution and mode of procedure in that
body, the representation in it of the Third Estate, and the
vote by orders. They were adjourned after a month's session;
and the court, contrary to the judgment of the majority
among them, proclaimed on the 27th of December,
1788, that the representatives of the Third Estate should
equal in number those of the two others combined. No
decision was given as to whether the votes should be individual,
or by orders.</p>

<p>Oczakow was taken by the Russians on the 17th of December,
1788, and during the following year the Eastern
war raged violently both in the Baltic and in southeastern
Europe. Turkey was everywhere worsted. Belgrade was
taken on the 8th of October by the Austrians, who afterwards
occupied Bucharest and advanced as far as Orsova.
The Russians reduced Galatz, Bender, and other places.
Besides losing territory, the Turks were defeated in several
pitched battles. The conduct of the war on their part was
much affected by the death of the reigning sultan.</p>

<p>The Swedish war was in its results unimportant, except
as a diversion in favor of Turkey. To keep it up
as such, subsidies were sent from Constantinople to Stockholm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Great Britain and Prussia were obliged again to
threaten Denmark, in 1789, to keep her from aiding Russia.
The British minister, speaking for both States, expressed
their fixed determination to maintain the balance
of power in the North. A defensive alliance was then
formed between Russia and Austria on the one hand, and
France and Spain on the other. The Bourbon kingdoms
pledged themselves to a strict neutrality in the Eastern
War as it then existed; but if Russia or Austria were attacked
by any other State, they were to be helped,—Austria,
by an army of sixty thousand men; Russia, by a fleet of
sixteen ships-of-the-line and twelve frigates. The latter
provision shows both the kind of attack feared by Russia
and the direction of her ambition.</p>

<p>On the 4th of May of this year, 1789, the States General
met at Versailles, and the French Revolution thenceforth
went on apace. The Bastille was stormed July 14th. In
October the royal family were brought forcibly from Versailles
to Paris by the mob. The earlier events of the
Revolution will hereafter be summarily related by themselves,
before going on with the war to which they led. It
will here be enough to say that the voice of France was
now silent outside her own borders.</p>

<p>In 1790 the Eastern War was practically brought to an
end. On the 31st of January a very close treaty of alliance
was made between Prussia and the Porte,—the king
binding himself to declare war at a set time against both
Russia and Austria. The emperor died in February, and
was succeeded by his brother Leopold, who was disposed
to peace. A convention was soon after held, at which sat
ministers of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, and the United
Provinces; the two latter acting as mediators because Prussia
had taken such a pronounced attitude of hostility to Austria.
A treaty was signed July 27, by which the emperor
renounced his alliance with Russia. On September 20, he
agreed to an armistice with Turkey; which, after long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
negotiation, was followed by a definitive peace, concluded
August 4, 1791.</p>

<p>The Russian conflict with Turkey languished during the
summer of 1790. Active operations began in October, and
continued during a season whose severities the Russian
could bear better than the Turk. The final blow of the
campaign and of the war was the taking of Ismail by
Suwarrow, a deed of arms so tremendous and full of horrors
that a brief account of its circumstances is allowable
even to our subject.</p>

<p>The town, which was looked on as the key of the lower
Danube, was surrounded by three lines of wall, each with
its proper ditch, and contained a garrison of thirteen
thousand. Its population, besides the troops, was about
thirty thousand. Owing to the season, December, Suwarrow
determined not to attempt a regular siege, but to carry
the place by assault, at any cost of life. Batteries were
consequently put up in every available place, and as rapidly
as possible, in order to prepare for and cover the attack.
At five o'clock Christmas morning they all opened together,
and, after a furious cannonade of two hours, the
Russians moved forward in eight columns. After a three
hours struggle the assailants were forced back; but Suwarrow,
whose influence over his soldiers was unbounded,
ran to the front, and, planting a Russian flag on one of
the enemy's works, asked his men if they would leave it
behind them. Through his efforts and those of the officers,
the troops returned to the charge. The conflict,
which must have resolved itself into a multitude of hand-to-hand
encounters, lasted till midnight, when, after an
eighteen hours fight, the third line of defence was carried
and resistance ceased, though bloodshed continued through
the night. It was computed at the time that thirty thousand
Turks, including women and children, and some
twenty thousand Russian soldiers died violent deaths during
that Christmas day of 1790. Warlike operations continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
during the spring, but preliminaries of peace between
Russia and Turkey were signed at Galatz on the
11th of August, 1791.</p>

<p>This put an end to hostilities throughout the East, peace
having been made between Russia and Sweden a year before,
on August 11, 1790. The time of attack had been
well chosen by the Swedish king, and had public opinion
in Great Britain approached unanimity, a powerful lever
would have been put in her hands to break down the Russian
attack on Turkey by supporting the diversion in the
North. The Russian and Swedish fleets were so evenly
balanced that a small British division would have turned
the scale, controlled the Baltic, and kept open the Swedish
communications from Finland to their own coast. So far,
however, was the nation from being of one mind that, as
we have seen, the minister's majority steadily fell, and he
probably knew that among those who voted straight, many
were far from hearty in his support. Prussia also did not
back Sweden as she should have done, after definitely
embracing that policy, though she was both disconcerted
and angered at the peace for which she had not looked.
This irresolution on the part of the allied States limited
their action to interposing between Sweden and Denmark,
and prevented the results which might reasonably have
been expected in the north, and yet more in the east of
Europe; but it does not take from the significance of their
attitude, nor hide the revolution in British statesmanship
which marks the ten years now being treated.</p>

<p>The tendency thus indicated was suddenly, though only
temporarily, checked by the Revolution in France. The
troubles that had been so long fomenting in that country
had, after a short and delusive period of seeming repose,
begun again at nearly the very moment that the Eastern
War was ending. This will be seen by bringing together
the dates at which were happening these weighty events
in the East and West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on the 6th of October, 1789, that the king and
royal family were brought from Versailles to Paris, unwilling
but constrained. After this outbreak of popular feeling,
comparative quiet continued through the last months
of 1789 and all of 1790, during which were fought in the
East the most important battles of the war, both in the
Baltic and on the Danube, including the bloody assault of
Ismail. During this time, however, Louis XVI. underwent
many bitter mortifications, either intended as such, or
else unavoidably humiliating to his sense of position. In
June, 1791, he fled with his family from Paris to put himself
in the care of part of the army stationed in eastern
France under the Marquis de Bouillé and believed to be
thoroughly trustworthy. Before reaching his destination
he was recognized, and brought back to Paris a prisoner.
The greeting of the royal family was significant of the
change that had passed over the people within a few years,
and which their unsuccessful flight had intensified. They
were met by perfect silence, while some distance ahead of
them rode an officer commanding the bystanders not to
uncover. Despite the distrust it felt, the Constituent Assembly
went on with the work of framing a constitution in
which the king still had a recognized position, and which
he formally accepted on the 14th of September, 1791.
During that summer, peace was signed between Russia
and Turkey, and a meeting was had at Pilnitz between
the emperor and the king of Prussia, after which they put
out their joint declaration that the situation in which the
king of France found himself was an object of common
concern to all the rulers of Europe; that "they hoped this
common concern would lead them to employ, in conjunction
with the two declaring sovereigns, the most efficacious
means, relative to their forces, in order to enable the king
of France to consolidate in the most perfect liberty, the
basis of a monarchical government equally suitable to the
rights of sovereigns and the welfare of the French nation."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
The two princes ended by stating their own readiness to
join in such united action with the force necessary to obtain
the common end proposed, and that they would, meanwhile,
give orders to their troops to be ready to put themselves
in a state of activity.</p>

<p>The close coincidence in date of the Declaration of Pilnitz,
August 27, 1791, with the Peace of Galatz, signed
August 11, is curious enough for passing remark; the one
formally opening the new channel of European interest
and action, while the other marked the close of the old.
The Declaration, however, was in the same line of effort
that the new emperor had for some time been following.
It met with a somewhat hesitating response. Russia and
Sweden agreed to raise an army, which Spain was to subsidize;
but Great Britain, under Pitt, declined to meddle
in the internal affairs of another state.</p>

<p>The first National or, as it is conveniently called, Constituent
Assembly, dissolved after framing a Constitution;
and the following day, October 1, 1791, the second Assembly,
known as the Legislative, came together. The Declaration
of Pilnitz had strongly moved the French people
and increased, perhaps unjustly, their distrust of the king.
This change of temper was reflected in the Assembly.
Strong representations and arguments were exchanged
between the ministers of foreign affairs in Austria and
France, through the ambassadors at either court; but in
truth there was no common ground of opinion on which
the new republic and the old empires could meet. The
movements on either side were viewed with studied suspicion,
and war was finally declared by France against Austria,
April 20, 1792. The first unimportant encounters
were unfavorable to the French; but more serious danger
than that which threatened from without was arising within
France itself. The king and the Assembly came into collision
through the use by the former of his constitutional
power of Veto. The agitation spread to the streets. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the 20th of June a deputation from the mob of Paris appeared
before the Assembly, and asked permission for the
citizens outside to defile before it, as a demonstration of
their support. The extraordinary request was granted;
and an immense crowd pressed forward, of people of all
ages, armed with weapons of every kind, among which appeared
a pike carrying the heart of a bull labelled an
"Aristocrat's heart." From the Assembly the crowd went
to the Louvre, and thence forced their way through the
palace gates into the king's presence. The unhappy Louis
bore himself with calm courage, to which perhaps he, at
the moment, owed his life; but he submitted to put on the
symbolic red cap, and to drink to the nation from a bottle
handed him by a drunken rioter.</p>

<p>Little was left in life for a king thus humbled, and his
final humiliation was close at hand. Prussia had not long
delayed to act in concert with the emperor, after France
declared war. On July 26, a month after the strange scene
in the Tuileries, was issued an exposition of her reasons
for taking arms; and at the same time the Duke of Brunswick,
commander-in-chief of the allied armies, put forth a
proclamation to the French framed in such violent terms
as to stir to the utmost the angry passions of a frantic and
excitable race. On the 10th of August the Paris mob
again stormed the Tuileries, the king and royal family fled
for safety to the hall of the Legislature, the Swiss Guards
were killed and the palace gutted. The Assembly then
decreed the suspension of the king; and on the 13th of
August the royal family was removed to the Temple, the
last home on earth for several of them.</p>

<p>On the 2d of September occurred the butcheries known
as the September Massacres. To this date and this act is
to be referred the great change in British feeling toward
the Revolution. On the 20th the battle of Valmy, by some
thought decisive of the fate of the Revolution, was won by
the French. Though being otherwise far from a battle of

the first importance, it led to the retreat of the allied forces
and destroyed for a time the hopes of the royalists. Two
days after Valmy met the third Assembly, the National
Convention of terrible memory. Its first act was to decree
the abolition of royalty in France; but the power that
swayed the country was passing more and more to the mob
of Paris, expressing itself through the clubs of which the
Jacobin is the best known. The violence and fanaticism
of the extreme republicans and of the most brutal elements
of the populace found ever louder voice. On the 19th of
November the Convention passed a decree declaring, "in
the name of the French nation, that they will grant fraternity
and assistance to all people who wish to recover
their liberty; and they charge the executive power to send
the necessary orders to the generals to give assistance to
such people, and to defend those citizens who have suffered,
or may suffer, in the cause of liberty." It was denied by
the French diplomatists that there was any intention of
favoring insurrections or exciting disturbances in any
friendly country; but such intention is nevertheless fairly
deducible from the words, and when a motion was made to
explain that they were not so meant, the Convention refused
to consider it. Mr. Fox, the ardent champion of the
Revolution in Parliament, spoke of this edict as an insult
to the British people.</p>

<p>Meantime the battle of Valmy had been followed by
that of Jemappes, fought November 6. On the 14th the
French army entered Brussels, and the Austrian Netherlands
were rapidly occupied. This was instantly succeeded
by a decree, dated November 16, opening the Scheldt, upon
the express ground of natural right; the boisterous young
republic cutting at one blow the knot which had refused to
be untied by the weak hands of Joseph II. Decided action
followed, a French squadron entering the river from the
sea and forcing its way up, despite the protests of the
Dutch officers, in order to take part in the siege of Antwerp.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
This was a new offence to the British Sea Power,
which was yet further angered by a decree of December
15, extending the French system to all countries occupied
by their armies. The words of this proclamation were so
sweeping that they could scarcely but seem, to those untouched
with the fiery passion of the Revolution, to threaten
the destruction of all existing social order. The British
ministry on the last day of the year 1792 declared that
"this government will never see with indifference that
France shall make herself, directly or indirectly, sovereign
of the Low Countries, or general arbitress of the rights and
liberties of Europe."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>While the Revolution was thus justifying the fears and
accusations of those who foretold that it could not confine
itself to the overturn of domestic institutions, but would
seek to thrust its beliefs and principles forcibly upon other
nations, the leaders were hurrying on the destruction of
the king. Arraigned on the 11th of December, 1792,
Louis XVI. was brought to trial on the 26th, sentenced to
death January 16, and executed January 21, 1793. This
deed brought to a decided issue the relations between
France and Great Britain, which, from an uncertain and
unsatisfactory condition, had become more and more embittered
by the course of events ever since the November
decree of fraternity. As far back as August 10, when the
king was suspended, the British government had recalled
its ambassador, who was not replaced; and had persisted
in attributing to the French minister in London an ambiguous
character, recognizing him only as accredited by the
king who had actually ceased to reign—by a government
which in fact no longer existed. Points of form were
raised with exasperating, yet civil, insolence, as to the
position which M. Chauvelin, the minister in question, actually
occupied; and his office was not made more pleasant
by the failure of his own government to send him new credentials.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Papers written by him were returned by Lord
Grenville, the foreign minister, because his claim to represent
the French republic was not recognized; or, if accepted,
they were only received as unofficial.</p>

<p>The letters thus exchanged, under forms so unsatisfactory,
were filled with mutual accusations, and arguments
marked by the brisk vivacity of the one nation and the
cool aggressiveness of the other; but starting as they did
from the differing bases of natural rights on the one hand,
and established institutions on the other, no agreement
was approached. The questions of the Scheldt, of the
decree of fraternity, and of that extending the French
system to countries occupied by their armies, were thus
disputed back and forth; and to them were added the
complaints of France against an Alien Act, passed by Parliament,
January 4, 1793, laying vexatious restrictions
upon the movements of foreigners arriving in Great Britain,
or wishing to change their abode if already resident.
This act M. Chauvelin rightly believed to be specially
aimed at Frenchmen. It sprang from the growing apprehension
and change of feeling in England; a change
emphasized by a break in the Parliamentary Opposition, a
large number of whom, in this same month of January,
1793, definitively took the step in which their great associate,
Edmund Burke, had preceded them, broke their
party ties, and passed over to the support of Pitt. The
latter would seem to have become convinced that war was
inevitable; that the question was no longer whether a nation
should exercise a right of changing its institutions,
but whether a plague should be stamped out before it had
passed its borders and infected yet healthy peoples.</p>

<p>Things had come to this state when news reached London
of the death sentence of the French king. M. Chauvelin
had just received and presented credentials from the
republican government. On January 20, the minister informed
him that the king, under present circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
did not think fit to receive them, adding the irritating
words: "As minister of the Most Christian King, you
would have enjoyed all the exemptions which the law
grants to public ministers, recognized as such; but as a
private person you cannot but return to the general mass
of foreigners resident in England."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> On the 24th of January,
the execution of Louis XVI. being now known, Lord
Grenville wrote to him: "The King can no longer, after
such an event, permit your residence here. His Majesty
has thought fit to order that you should retire from the
kingdom within the space of eight days, and I herewith
transmit to you a copy of the order which His Majesty has
given me to that effect."<a name="FNanchor_12a_12a" id="FNanchor_12a_12a"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>On the 1st of February, 1793, the French republic declared
war against Great Britain and Holland. It was
already at war with Austria, Prussia and Sardinia; while
Russia and Sweden were avowedly unfriendly, and Spain
almost openly hostile.</p>

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Condition of the Navies in 1793—and especially of
the French Navy.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE following the narrative of directly warlike action,
or discussing the influence of the naval factor
upon the military and political events, it is proper to examine
the relative position, strength, and resources, of the
rival nations, particularly in the matter of Sea Power,—to
weigh the chances of the struggle, as it were, beforehand,
from the known conditions,—to analyze and point
out certain reasons why the sea war took the turn it did,
in order that the experience of the past may be turned to
the profit of the future.</p>

<p>First of all, it must be recognized that the problem to be
thus resolved is by no means so simple as in most wars.
It is not here a mere question of the extent, population,
and geographical position of a country; of the number of
its seamen, the tonnage of its shipping, the strength of its
armed fleet; nor yet again, chiefly of the wealth and vigor
of its colonies, the possession of good and well-placed maritime
bases in different parts of the world; not even, at
first hand, of the policy and character of its government,
although it is undoubtedly true that in the action of
French governments is to be found the chief reason for
the utter disaster and overthrow which awaited the Sea
Power of France. It was because the government so faithfully
and necessarily reflected the social disorder, the
crude and wild habits of thought which it was powerless
to check, that it was incapable of dealing with the naval
necessities of the day. The seamen and the navy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
France were swept away by the same current of thought
and feeling which was carrying before it the whole nation;
and the government, tossed to and fro by every wave of
popular emotion, was at once too weak and too ignorant
of the needs of the service to repress principles and to
amend defects which were fatal to its healthy life.</p>

<p>It is particularly instructive to dwell upon this phase
of the revolutionary convulsions of France, because the
result in this comparatively small, but still most important,
part of the body politic was so different from that
which was found elsewhere. Whatever the mistakes, the
violence, the excesses of every kind, into which this popular
rising was betrayed, they were symptomatic of strength,
not of weakness,—deplorable accompaniments of a movement
which, with all its drawbacks, was marked by overwhelming
force.</p>

<p>It was the inability to realize the might in this outburst
of popular feeling, long pent up, that caused the mistaken
forecasts of many statesmen of the day; who judged of
the power and reach of the movement by indications—such
as the finances, the condition of the army, the quality
of the known leaders—ordinarily fairly accurate tests of
a country's endurance, but which utterly misled those who
looked to them only and did not take into account the
mighty impulse of a whole nation stirred to its depths.
Why, then, was the result so different in the navy? Why
was it so weak, not merely nor chiefly in quantity, but in
quality? and that, too, in days so nearly succeeding the
prosperous naval era of Louis XVI. Why should the
same throe which brought forth the magnificent armies
of Napoleon have caused the utter weakness of the sister
service, not only amid the disorders of the Republic, but
also under the powerful organization of the Empire?</p>

<p>The immediate reason was that, to a service of a very
special character, involving special exigencies, calling for
special aptitudes, and consequently demanding special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
knowledge of its requirements in order to deal wisely with
it, were applied the theories of men wholly ignorant of
those requirements,—men who did not even believe that
they existed. Entirely without experimental knowledge,
or any other kind of knowledge, of the conditions of sea
life, they were unable to realize the obstacles to those processes
by which they would build up their navy, and according
to which they proposed to handle it. This was
true not only of the wild experiments of the early days of
the Republic; the reproach may fairly be addressed to the
great emperor himself, that he had scarcely any appreciation
of the factors conditioning efficiency at sea; nor did he
seemingly ever reach any such sense of them as would
enable him to understand why the French navy failed.
"Disdaining," says Jean Bon Saint-André, the Revolutionary
commissioner whose influence on naval organization
was unbounded, "<i>disdaining</i>, through calculation and reflection,
<i>skilful evolutions</i>, perhaps our seamen will think
it more fitting and useful to try those boarding actions in
which the Frenchman was always conqueror, and thus astonish
Europe by new prodigies of valor."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> "Courage and
audacity," says Captain Chevalier, "had become in his
eyes the only qualities necessary to our officers." "The
English," said Napoleon, "will become very small when
France shall have two or three admirals willing to die.
"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
So commented, with pathetic yet submissive irony, the ill-fated
admiral, Villeneuve, upon whom fell the weight of
the emperor's discontent with his navy: "Since his Majesty
thinks that nothing but audacity and resolve are needed to
succeed in the naval officer's calling, I shall leave nothing
to be desired."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It is well to trace in detail the steps by which a fine
military service was broken down, as well as the results
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
thus reached, for, while the circumstances under which the
process began were undoubtedly exceptional, the general
lesson remains good. To disregard the teachings of experience,
to cut loose wholly from the traditions of the past,
to revolutionize rather than to reform, to launch out boldly
on new and untried paths, blind to or ignoring the difficulties
to be met,—such a tendency, such a school of thought
exists in every generation. At times it gets the mastery.
Certainly at the present day it has unusual strength, which
is not to be wondered at in view of the change and development
of naval weapons. Yet if the campaigns of Cæsar
and Hannibal are still useful studies in the days of firearms,
it is rash to affirm that the days of sail have no lessons
for the days of steam. Here, however, are to be
considered questions of discipline and organization; of the
adaptation of means to ends; of the recognition, not only
of the possibilities, but also of the limitations, imposed
upon a calling, upon a military organization, by the nature
of the case, by the element in which it moves, by the force
to which it owes its motion, by the skill or lack of skill
with which its powers are used and its deficiencies compensated.</p>

<p>It is indeed only by considering the limitations as well
as the possibilities of any form of warlike activity, whether
it be a general plan of action,—as for instance commerce-destroying,—or
whether it be the use of a particular
weapon,—such as the ram,—that correct conclusions can
be reached as to the kind of men, in natural capacities, in
acquired skill, in habits of thought and action, who are
needed to use such weapon. The possibilities of the ram,
for instance, are to be found in the consequences of a successful
thrust; its limitations, in the difficulties imposed by
any lack of handiness, speed, or steering qualities in the
ship carrying it, in the skill of the opponent in managing
his vessel and the weapons with which he is provided for
counter-offence. If these limitations are carefully considered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
there will be little doubt how to answer the question
as to the chance of a man picked up at hazard, untrained
for such encounter except by years of ordinary sea-going,
reaching his aim if pitted against another who has at least
given thought and had some professional training directed
to the special end.</p>

<p>Now the one sea-weapon of the period of the French
Revolution was the gun; the cold steel, the hand-to-hand
fight, commonly came into play only toward the end of an
action, if at all. In naming the gun, however, it can by
no means be separated from its carriage; using this word
not merely in its narrow technical sense, but as belonging
rightly to the whole ship which bore the gun alongside the
enemy, and upon whose skilful handling depended placing
it in those positions of advantage that involved most danger
to the opponent and the least to one's self. This was the
part of the commander; once there, the skill of the gunner
came into play, to work his piece with rapidity and accuracy
despite the obstacles raised by the motion of the sea,
the rapid shifting of the enemy, the difficulty of catching
sight of him through the narrow ports. Thus the skill of
the military seaman and the skill of the trained gunner,
the gun and the ship, the piece and its carriage, supplemented
each other. The ship and its guns together formed
one weapon, a moving battery which needed quick and
delicate handling and accurate direction in all its parts.
It was wielded by a living organism, knit also into one by
the dependence of all the parts upon the head, and thus
acting by a common impulse, sharing a common tradition,
and having a common life, which, like all other life, is not
found fully ripened without having had a beginning and a
growth.</p>

<p>It would be foolish, because untrue, to say that these
things were easy to see. They were easy to men of the
profession; they were not at all easy to outsiders, apt to
ignore difficulties of which they have neither experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
nor conception. The contempt for skilful manœuvres was
not confined to Jean Bon Saint-André, though he was unusually
open in avowing it. But the difficulties none the less
existed; neither is the captain without the gunner, nor the
gunner without the captain, and both must be specially
trained men. It was not to be expected that the man
newly taken from the merchant vessel, whose concern with
other ships was confined to keeping out of their way, should
at once be fitted to manœuvre skilfully around an antagonist
actively engaged in injuring him, nor yet be ready to
step at once from the command of a handful of men
shipped for a short cruise, to that of a numerous body
which he was to animate with a common spirit, train to
act together for a common purpose, and subject to a
common rigorous discipline to which he himself was, by
previous habit, a stranger. The yoke of military service
sits hard on those who do not always bear it. Yet the
efficiency of the military sea-officer depended upon his fitness
to do these things well because they had been so
wrought into his own personal habit as to become a second
nature.</p>

<p>This was true, abundantly true, of the single ship in
fight: but when it came to the question of combining the
force of a great many guns, mounted on perhaps twenty-five
or thirty heavy ships, possessing unequal qualities, but
which must nevertheless keep close to one another, in certain
specified positions, on dark nights, in bad weather,
above all when before the enemy; when these ships were
called upon to perform evolutions all together, or in succession,
to concentrate upon a part of the enemy, to frustrate
by well combined and well executed movements
attacks upon themselves, to remedy the inconveniences
arising from loss of sails and masts and consequent loss of
motive power, to provide against the disorders caused by
sudden changes of wind and the various chances of the
sea,—under these conditions, even one not having the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
knowledge of experience begins to see that such demands
can only be met by a body of men of special aptitudes and
training, such as in fact has very rarely, if ever, been found
in perfection, in even the most highly organized fleets of
any navy in the world.</p>

<p>To these things the French National Assembly was
blind, but not because it was not warned of them. In truth
men's understandings, as well as their <i>morale</i> and beliefs,
were in a chaotic state. In the navy, as in society, the
<i>morale</i> suffered first. Insubordination and mutiny, insult
and murder, preceded the blundering measures which in
the end destroyed the fine <i>personnel</i> that the monarchy
bequeathed to the French republic. This insubordination
broke out very soon after the affairs of the Bastille and
the forcing of the palace at Versailles; that is, very soon
after the powerlessness of the executive was felt. Singularly,
yet appropriately, the first victim was the most distinguished
flag-officer of the French navy.</p>

<p>During the latter half of 1789 disturbances occurred in
all the seaport towns; in Havre, in Cherbourg, in Brest, in
Rochefort, in Toulon. Everywhere the town authorities
meddled with the concerns of the navy yards and of the
fleet; discontented seamen and soldiers, idle or punished,
rushed to the town halls with complaints against their
officers. The latter, receiving no support from Paris,
yielded continually, and things naturally went from bad to
worse.</p>

<p>In Toulon, however, matters were worst of all. The
naval commander-in-chief in that port was Commodore
D'Albert de Rions, a member of the French nobility, as
were all the officers of the navy. He was thought the most
able flag-officer in the fleet; he was also known and beloved
in Toulon for his personal integrity and charitable life.
After working his way with partial success through the
earlier disorders, by dint of tact, concession, and his own
personal reputation, he found himself compelled to send on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
shore from the fleet two subordinate officers who had excited
mutiny. The men went at once to the town hall,
where they were received with open arms, and a story before
prevalent was again started that the city was mined
and would be attacked the day or two following. Excitement
spread, and the next day a number of people assembled
round the arsenal, demanding to speak with De Rions.
He went out with a few of his officers. The crowd closed
round and forced him away from the gates. He went
toward his house, apparently his official residence, the mob
hustling, insulting, and even laying hands on his person.
Having reached his home, the mayor and another city official
came to him and asked forgiveness for the two culprits.
He refused for a long time, but at length yielded against
his judgment,—saying truly enough that such an act of
weakness, wrung from him by the commune on the plea of
re-establishing order, in other words of appeasing and so
quieting the rabble, would but encourage new disorders
and do irreparable wrong to discipline and the state.</p>

<p>It proved also insufficient to arrest the present tumult.
An officer coming to the door was insulted and attacked.
A rioter rushed at another, who was leaning over a terrace
attached to the house, and cut his head open with
a sabre. Then the windows were broken. The national
guard, or, as we might say, the city militia, were paraded,
but did no service. An officer leaving the house was attacked,
knocked down with stones and the butts of muskets,
and would have lost his life had not De Rions sallied
out with thirty others and carried him off.</p>

<p>The national guard now surrounded the house, forbidding
entry or withdrawal, and soon after demanded the
surrender of an officer whom they accused of having ordered
some seamen-gunners to fire on the mob. To De
Rions's explanations and denials they replied that he was
a liar, and that the officers were a lot of aristocrats who
wished to assassinate the people. The commodore refusing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to give up his subordinate, the guards prepared to
attack them; thereupon all drew their swords, but the
officer himself, to save his comrades, stepped quickly out
and put himself in the hands of his enemies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the city authorities, as is too usual, made
no effective interference. Part of their own forces, the
national guards, were foremost in the riot. Soon after,
De Rions was required to give up another officer. He
again refused, and laid orders upon this one not to yield
himself as the former had done. "If you want another
victim," said he, stepping forward, "here am I; but if you
want one of my officers, you must first pass over me."
His manliness caused only irritation. A rush was made,
his sword snatched from him, and he himself dragged out
of the house amid the hoots and jeers of the mob. The
national guards formed two parties,—one to kill, the other
to save him. Pricked with bayonets, clubbed with muskets,
and even ignominiously kicked, this gallant old seaman,
the companion of De Grasse and Suffren, was
dragged through the streets amid cries of "Hang him!
Cut off his head!" and thrust into the common prison.
Bad as all this was, there was yet worse. Any age and
any country may suffer from a riot, but De Rions could
get from the national authority no admission of his
wrongs. The assembly ordered an investigation, and six
weeks later made this declaration: "The National Assembly,
taking a favorable view of the motives which
animated M. D'Albert de Rions, the other naval officers
implicated in the affair, <i>the municipal officers, and the
National Guard</i>, declares that there is no ground to blame
any one."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
De Rions told his wrongs in words equally
pathetic and dignified: "The volunteers," said he, "have
outraged the decrees of the National Assembly in all that
concerns the rights of the man and of the citizen. Let us
not here be considered, if you will, as officers, and I myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
as the head of a respectable corps; see in us only quiet
and well-behaved citizens, and every honest man cannot
but be revolted at the unjust and odious treatment we
have undergone."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> His words were not heeded.</p>

<p>The Toulon affair was the signal for the spread of mutiny
among the crews and the breaking-up of the corps
of commissioned sea-officers. Similar incidents occurred
often and everywhere. The successor of De Rions was
also hauled by the mob to prison, where he remained several
days. The second in command to him, a little later,
was dragged to a gallows, whence he was only accidentally
delivered. In Brest, a captain who had been ordered to
command a ship on foreign service was assaulted as an
aristocrat by a mob of three thousand people and only
saved by being taken to prison, where he remained with
nineteen others similarly detained. Orders to release
them and prosecute the offenders were issued in vain by
the cabinet and the king. "It was evident," says Chevalier,
"that the naval officers could no longer depend upon
the support of local authorities, nor upon that of the
government; they were outlaws."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> "Thenceforth," says
another French naval historian, "if some naval officers
were found sanguine enough and patriotic enough to be
willing to remain at their post, they but came, on account
of their origin and without further inquiry, to the prison
and to the scaffold."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In the fleets, insubordination soon developed into anarchy.
In the spring of 1790 a quarrel arose between
Spain and Great Britain, on account of the establishment
of trading-posts, by British subjects, at Nootka Sound, on
the north-west coast of America. These posts, with the
vessels at them, were seized by Spanish cruisers. Upon
news of the affair both nations made conflicting claims,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and both began to arm their fleets. Spain claimed the
help of France, in virtue of the still existing Bourbon
Family Compact. The king sent a message to the Assembly,
which voted to arm forty-five ships-of-the-line.
D'Albert de Rions was ordered to command the fleet at
Brest, where he was coldly received by the city authorities.
The seamen at the time were discontented at certain
new regulations. De Rions, seeing the danger of the situation,
recommended to the Assembly some modifications,
which it refused to make, yet, at the same time, took no
vigorous steps to ensure order. On the same day that it
confirmed its first decree, September 15, 1790, a seaman
from a ship called the "Léopard," visiting on board another,
the "Patriote," used mutinous language and insulted one
of the principal officers. The man was drunk. The case
being reported to the admiral, he ordered him sent on
board the flag-ship. This measure, though certainly very
mild, called forth great indignation among the seamen of
the "Patriote." De Rions, hearing that mutiny was beginning,
summoned before him a petty officer, a coxswain,
who was actively stirring up the crew. He quietly explained
to this man that the first offender had not even
been punished. The coxswain, being insolent, was sent
back, saying, as he went, "that it belonged to the strongest
to make the law; that he was the strongest, and that
the man should not be punished."</p>

<p>The next morning the admiral went to the "Patriote,"
mustered the crew, told them that the first offender had
not been punished, but that the conduct of the coxswain
had been so bad that he must be put in confinement. The
crew kept silent so far, but now broke out into cries of
"He shall not go." De Rions, having tried in vain to re-establish
order, took his boat to go ashore and consult with
the commandant of the arsenal. As he pulled away, several
seamen cried out to her coxswain, "Upset the boat!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile a riot had broken out in the town against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
second in command at the dockyard, based upon a report
that he had said he would soon bring the San Domingo
rebels to order, if he were sent against them. This officer,
named Marigny, one of a distinguished naval family, only
escaped death by being out of his house; a gallows was
put up before it. These various outrages moved the National
Assembly for a moment, but its positive action went
no further than praying the king to order a prosecution
according to legal forms, and ordering that the crew of the
Léopard, which ship had been the focus of sedition, should
be sent to their homes. D'Albert de Rions, seeing that he
could not enforce obedience, asked for and obtained his
relief. On the 15th of October this distinguished officer
took his final leave of the navy and left the country. He
had served at Grenada, at Yorktown, and against Rodney,
and when the great Suffren, bending under the burden of
cares in his Indian campaign, sought for a second upon
whom the charge might fitly fall, he wrote thus to the
minister of the day: "If my death, or my health, should
leave the command vacant, who would take my place?...
I know only one person who has all the qualities that can
be desired; who is very brave, very accomplished, full of
ardor and zeal, disinterested, a good seaman. That is
D'Albert de Rions, and should he be in America even, send
a frigate for him. I shall be good for more if I have him,
for he will help me; and if I die, you will be assured that
the service will not suffer. If you had given me him when
I asked you, we should now be masters of India."

<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It was a significant, though accidental, coincidence that
the approaching humiliation of the French navy should
thus be prefigured, both ashore and afloat, both north and
south, on the Mediterranean and on the Atlantic, in the
person of its most distinguished representative. The incidents,
however, though conspicuous, were but samples of
what was going on everywhere. In the West India colonies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the revolutionary impulse transmitted from the
mother-country had taken on a heat and violence of its
own, characteristic alike of the climate and of the undisciplined
temper of the colonists. Commotions amounting to
civil war broke out, and both parties tried to command the
support of the navy, even at the price of inciting mutiny.
Here the Léopard, afterwards the centre of the Brest
mutiny, first inhaled the germs of disorder. In July, 1790,
the crew revolted, and deprived the captain of the command,
to assume which, however, only one commissioned officer
was found willing. The commandant of the naval station
at the Isle of France, Captain McNamara, after once escaping
threatened death, was enticed ashore under promise
of protection, and then murdered in the streets by the colonial
troops themselves. In the peninsula of India, Great
Britain, being then at war with Tippoo Saib, undertook to
search neutral vessels off the coast. The French commodore
sent a frigate to convoy two merchant ships, and the
attempt of the British to search them led to a collision, in
which the French vessel hauled down her colors after losing
twelve killed and fifty-six wounded. The significance,
however, of this affair lies in the fact that when the commandant
of the division announced that another such
aggression would be not only resisted, but followed by reprisals,
the crews of two ships told him they would not
fight unless attacked. The officer, being thus unable to
maintain what he thought the honor of the flag demanded,
found it necessary to abandon the station.</p>

<p>Things abroad thus went on from bad to worse. Ships-of-war
arriving in San Domingo, the most magnificent of
the French colonies in size and fruitfulness, were at once
boarded by the members of the party uppermost in the
port. Flattered and seduced, given money and entertainment,
filled with liquor, the crews were easily persuaded
to mutiny. Here and there an officer gifted with tact and
popularity, or perhaps an adept in that deft cajoling with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
words which so takes with the French people, and of which
the emperor afterwards was so great a master, induced
rather than ordered his ship's company to do their duty up
to a certain point. As usual the tragedy of the situation
had a comical side. Three ships, one of the line, anchored
in San Domingo. The seamen as usual were worked upon;
but in addition two of the commanders, with several officers,
were arrested on shore and, after being threatened
with death, were deprived of their commands by the local
assembly. The next day the crew of the ship-of-the-line
sent ashore to protest against the deprivation, which, they
observed, "was null and void, as to them alone (the crew)
belonged the right to take cognizance of and judge the
motives of their officers."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> An admiral on the United
States coast was ordered by the French chargé d'affaires
to take his ships, two of-the-line and two frigates, and
seize the little islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon near
Newfoundland. A few days after sailing, the crews said
the orders were nonsense and forced the officers to go to
France<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
No captain knew how long he would be in his
nominal position, or receive the obedience it claimed. "It
was not so easy," says a French historian, speaking of the
one who most successfully kept his dizzy height, "it was
not so easy for Grimouard to leave Port-au-Prince with his
flag-ship; he had to get the consent of a crew which was
incessantly told that its own will was the only orders it
should follow. In fifteen months Grimouard had not taken
a night's rest; always active, always on deck, reasoning
with one, coaxing another, appealing to the honor of this,
to the generosity of that, to the patriotism of all, he had
kept up on board a quasi-discipline truly phenomenal for
the times."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Later on, this same man lost his life by the
guillotine. Nothing more disastrous to the French colonies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
could have happened than this weakening of the military
authority, both ashore and afloat, for which the colonists
were mainly answerable. The strife of parties,—at first
confined to the whites, a very small minority of the population,—spread
to the mixed bloods and the negroes, and a
scene of desolation followed over all the islands, finding
however its most frightful miseries and excesses in San
Domingo, whence the whites were finally exterminated.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of anarchy in which the fleet
was as early as 1790 and 1791, and to which the whole
social order was unmistakably drifting. In the military
services, and above all in the navy, where submission to
constituted authority is the breath of life, the disappearance
of that submission anticipated, but only anticipated, the
period of ruin and terror which awaited all France. The
weakness which prevented the executive and legislature
from enforcing obedience in the fleet was hurrying them,
along with the whole people, to the abysses of confusion;
the more highly organized and fragile parts of the state
first fell to pieces under the shaking of the whole fabric.
After what has been said, little surprise will be felt that
naval officers in increasing numbers refused to serve and
left the country; but it is a mistake to say on the one hand
that they did so from pure motives of opposition to the new
order of things, or on the other that they were forced by
the acts of the first, or Constituent, Assembly. Both mistakes
have been made. Emigration of the nobility and of
princes of the blood began indeed soon after the storming
of the Bastille, but large numbers of officers remained attending
to their duties. The Brest mutiny was fourteen
months later, and complaints are not then found of the lack
of officers.</p>

<p>After that event their departure went on with increasing
rapidity. The successor of De Rions held his office but one
week, and then gave it up. He was followed by a distinguished
officer, De Bougainville. Aided by a temporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
return to sober ideas on the part of the government and
the town authorities, this flag-officer for a moment, by
strong measures, restored discipline; but mutiny soon reappeared,
and, from the complaints made by him later on,
there can be little doubt that he must have asked for his
detachment had not the fleet been disarmed in consequence
of the ending of the Anglo-Spanish dispute. In the following
March, 1791, Mirabeau died, and with him the hopes
which the court party and moderate men had based upon
his genius. In April the Assembly passed a bill re-organizing
the navy, the terms of which could not have been
acceptable to the officers; although, candidly read, it cannot
be considered to have ignored the just claims of those
actually in service. In June occurred the king's unsuccessful
attempt at flight. On the first of July a return
made of officers of the navy showed that more than three-fourths
of the old corps had disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The result was
due partly to royalist feeling and prejudice shocked; partly,
perhaps, to distaste for the new organization: but those
familiar with the feelings of officers will attribute it with
more likelihood to the utter subversion of discipline, destructive
to their professional pride and personal self-respect,
and for which the weakness and military ignorance
of the Constituent Assembly are mainly responsible.</p>

<p>It is now time to consider the plans upon which that
Assembly proposed to re-create the navy, in accordance
with the views popular at that day.</p>

<p>During the War of the American Revolution, the corps
of naval officers had been found too small for the needs of
the service; there was a deficiency of lieutenants and
junior officers to take charge of the watches and gun-divisions.
A systematic attempt was made to remedy this
trouble in the future. By a royal decree, dated January
1, 1786, the navy was re-organized, and two sources of
supply for officers were opened. The first was drawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
wholly from the nobles, the youths composing it having to
show satisfactory proofs of nobility before being admitted
to the position of <i>élèves</i>, as they were called. These received
a practical and rigorous training especially directed
to the navy; and, so far as education went, there is reason
to believe they would have made a most efficient body of
men. The second source from which the royal navy was
to be supplied with officers was a class called volunteers.
Admission to this was also restricted, though extended to
a wider circle. There could be borne upon its rolls only
the sons of noblemen, or of sub-lieutenants serving either
afloat or in the dockyards, of wholesale merchants, shipowners,
captains, and of people living "nobly." These,
though required to pass certain examinations and to have
seen certain sea-service, were only admitted to the grade
of sub-lieutenant, and could be promoted no further except
for distinguished and exceptional acts.
<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Such was the organization with which, in 1791, a popular
assembly was about to deal. The invidious privilege by
which the naval career, except in the lower ranks, was
closed to all but a single, and not specially deserving, class,
was of course done away without question. There still remained
to decide whether the privilege should in the future
be confined to a single class, which should deserve it by
giving all its life and energies to the career—whether the
navy should be recognized as a special calling requiring
like others a special training—or whether there was so little
difference between it and the merchant service that men
could pass from one to the other without injuring either.
These two views each found upholders, but the latter prevailed
even in the first Assembly; those who wished a
wholly military service only succeeded in modifying the
original scheme presented by the committee.</p>

<p>The new organization was established by two successive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
acts, passed on the 22d and 28th of April, 1790.
<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Like the
old, it provided two sources of supply; the one from men specially
trained in youth, the other from the merchant service.
The former began in a class called <i>Aspirants</i>, three
hundred of whom were in pay on board ships of war; they
were not then officers, but simply youths between fifteen
and twenty learning their business. The lowest grade
of officer was the <i>Enseigne</i>; they were of two kinds,
paid<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and unpaid, the former being actually in the navy.
The latter were in the merchant service, but susceptible of
employment in the fleet, and, when so engaged, took rank
with other <i>enseignes</i> according to the length of time afloat
in national ships. Admission to the grade of paid, or
naval, <i>enseigne</i> could be had between eighteen and thirty,
by passing the required examination and proving four
years service at sea, no distinction being then made in
favor of those who had begun as <i>aspirants</i> or had served in
the navy. Those passing for <i>enseigne</i> and wishing to enter
the navy had a more severe and more mathematical examination,
while, on the other hand, those who returned to
the merchant service had to have two years longer service,
six in all, one of which on board a ship of war. All <i>enseignes</i>
twenty-four years old, and only they, could command
ships in the foreign trade and certain parts of the
home, or coasting, trade. By the age of forty, a definitive
choice had to be made between the two services. Up to
that time <i>enseignes</i> could pass for lieutenant, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
seems to have been no inducement to follow one branch of
the sea service rather than the other, except this: that
five-sixths of the lieutenant vacancies at any one time were
to be given to those who had most service as <i>enseignes</i> on
board ships of war. To pass for lieutenant at the mature
age of forty, only two years of military sea service were
absolutely required. Thenceforth the officer was devoted
to the military navy.</p>

<p>The essential spirit and tendency of the new legislation
is summed up in the requirements for the lieutenancy.
Up to the age of forty, that is, during the formative years
of a man's life, it was left to the choice, interest, or caprice
of the individual, how he would pass his time between
the two services. The inducements to stick to the
navy were too slight to weigh against the passing inclinations
of young or restless men. If the navy is the specialty
that has been before asserted, there can be no doubt
that this scheme was radically vicious. A period of commercial
prosperity would have robbed it of its best men
during their best years.</p>

<p>It is due to the Constituent Assembly to say that, while
thus establishing the navy of the future on foundations
that reason and experience have both condemned, it did
not, as has sometimes been said, reject or drive away the
able officers still in France; that is, by direct legislative
act. Although the decree of April 22 abolished the existing
corps of the navy, it provided also that the new
organization should be constituted, "for this time only,"
by a selection made from the officers of the old service
then available; from whom the higher grades, including
lieutenants, were to be, as far as possible, filled. Those
who were not so selected were to be retired with at least
two-thirds of their present pay; and with the next higher
grade, if they had served over ten years in the one they
then held. Whatever dislike these officers may rightly
have felt for the new organization, they personally lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
little by it, unless not selected; but the failure on the part
of the Assembly to realize the irreparable loss with which
the country was threatened,—the unique value of a body of
men already, and alone, fitted for the performance of very
delicate duties,—and the consequent neglect to uphold and
protect them, were as fatal in their results as though they
had been legislated out of existence.</p>

<p>The second, or Legislative, Assembly during its year
of existence made no radical changes in the organization
it found; but the increasing want of officers led inevitably
to lowering the qualifications exacted for the different
grades, which was done by several acts. The National
Convention went still farther in the same direction. January
13, 1793, immediately before the war with Great
Britain, it decreed that rear-admirals might be taken from
any captains whose commission dated back the month before.
Merchant captains who had commanded privateers
or ships in the foreign trade for five years, could be at once
made post-captains. To be made lieutenant were needed
only five years' sea-service, either in the navy or on board
merchant ships. Decree now followed decree, all in the
same direction, winding up on July 28 by authorizing the
minister of marine, until otherwise ordered, to fill the
places of flag and other officers from any grade and without
regard to existing laws. Most of these measures were
probably justified by stern and pressing necessity.
<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The reign of terror was now at hand. The scourge fell
upon the naval officers who had not fled the country as
well as upon others. Grimouard, whose activity in the
West Indies has been noted; Philippe d'Orléans, admiral
of France, who had commanded the van at Ushant; Vice-Admiral
Kersaint, who had stood in the foremost rank of
revolutionists till the murder of the king; D'Estaing, also
admiral of France, who had held high command with distinguished
courage, if not with equal ability, in the war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of American Independence,—perished on the scaffold.
The companions of their glory had for the most died before
the evil days. D'Orvilliers, De Grasse, Guichen, the
first Latouche-Tréville, Suffren, La Motte Piquet, passed
away before the meeting of the States-General.</p>

<p>Besides the judicial and other murders, the effect of the
general suspiciousness was felt by the navy in new legislation
of a yet more disastrous kind. By a decree of
October 7, 1793, the minister of marine was to lay before
the naval committee of the Assembly a list of all officers
and <i>aspirants</i> whose ability or <i>civisme</i>,—<i>i. e.</i>, fidelity to the
new order of things,—was suspected. This may have been
well enough; but, in addition, lists of all officers and <i>aspirants</i>
were to be posted in different places, and all people
were invited to send in denunciations of those whom
they believed to be lacking in ability or fidelity. These
denunciations were to be passed upon by an assembly,
made up of the general council of the Commune and all
the seamen of the district. The decision was reached by
majority of votes and forwarded to the minister, who was
obliged to dismiss those against whom the charges were
thus sustained.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The navy being in this way purged, the vacancies were
to be filled on a similar principle. The naval officers, merchant
captains and other seamen of each district, who
had qualified for <i>enseignes</i>, were to meet and name three
candidates for each of the different vacancies. In the
great want of officers then prevailing, some such system of
nomination might have been very useful in lightening the
immense burden resting on the minister; but it is obvious
that the assemblies thus constituted were too numerous,
too popular, too little fitted to carry on formal discussion,
and too destitute of special technical knowledge, to be good
judges. There was found here the same essential defect
that underlay all the conceptions of the different assemblies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of the early republic; ignorant of, and therefore undervaluing,
the high and special requirements of the naval
profession, they were willing to entrust its interests and
the selection of its officers to hands that could not be
competent.</p>

<p>The result was depicted in a letter of Admiral Villaret
Joyeuse, who was at once an officer of the old service, and
yet had entered it from the auxiliary navy, having been
captain of fireship; who, therefore, stood as nearly as possible
between the two extremes of opinion. As a subordinate
he had won the admiration of Suffren in the East
Indies, and as admiral he commanded with honor the
fleets of the Republic. He wrote: "The popular societies
have been called on to point out the men having both seamanship
and patriotism. The societies believed that it
was enough for a man to have been long at sea to be a
seaman, if he was besides a patriot. They did not reflect
that patriotism alone cannot handle a ship. The grades
consequently have been given to men without merit beyond
that of having been much at sea, not remembering
that such a man often is in a ship just as a bale is. It
must be frankly said it is not always the man at once most
skilful and patriotic that has had the suffrages of the societies,
but often the most intriguing and the falsest,—he,
who by effrontery and talk has been able to impose upon
the majority."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
In another letter he says: "You doubtless
know that the best seamen of the different commercial
ports kept behind the curtain in the beginning of the Revolution;
and that on the other hand there came forward a
crowd who, not being able to find employment in commerce,
because they had no other talent than the phraseology
of patriotism, by means of which they misled the
popular societies of which they were members, got the first
appointments. Experienced captains, who might have
served the republic efficiently by their talents and skill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
have since then steadily refused to go to sea, and with inexcusable
self-love still prefer service in the National Guard
(ashore) to going to sea, where they say they would have
to be under captains to whom they have often refused the
charge of a watch. Hence the frequent accidents met
with by the ships of the republic. Since justice and consequently
talents are now (1795) the order of the day, and
all France is now convinced that patriotism, doubtless one
of the most necessary virtues in an officer of the government,
is yet not the only one required to command armies
and fleets, as was once claimed, you are quite right," etc.
<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Enough has been said to show the different causes that
destroyed the corps of French naval officers. Some of
these were exceptional in their character and not likely
to recur; but it is plain that even their operation was hastened
by the false notions prevalent in the government as
to the character and value of professional training, while
the same false notions underlay the attempts both to fill
the vacant places and to provide a new basis for the official
staff of the future. The results of these mistaken ideas
will be seen in the narrative; but it may be useful to give
here the professional antecedents (taken from a French
naval historian) of the admirals and captains in the first
great battle of this war, June 1, 1794, by which time
the full effect of the various changes had been reached.
These three admirals and twenty-six captains of 1794 held
in 1791 the following positions: the commander-in-chief,
Villaret Joyeuse, was a lieutenant; the two other flag-officers,
one a lieutenant, the other a sub-lieutenant; of
the captains, three were lieutenants, eleven sub-lieutenants,
nine captains or mates of merchant ships, one a seaman
in the navy, one a boatswain, one not given.
<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The action of the Assemblies with regard to the enlisted
men of the fleet was as unreasonable and revolutionary as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
that touching the officers. For twenty years before the
meeting of the States-General the navy had contained
nine divisions of trained seamen-gunners, numbering some
ten thousand men, and commanded, as in all services, by
naval officers. It is scarcely possible to over-rate the
value, in <i>esprit-de-corps</i> as well as in fighting effect, of
such a body of trained men. In 1792 these were replaced
by a force of marine artillerists, commanded by artillery
officers. The precise relation of these to the sea-officers
is not stated; but from the change must have sprung
jealousies harmful to discipline, as well as injury to the
military spirit of the naval officer. In 1794, these marine
artillerists, and also the marine infantry, were suppressed
on motion of Jean Bon Saint-André, so well known in connection
with the French navy of the day. In his opinion,
endorsed by the vote of the National Convention, it savored
of aristocracy that any body of men should have an exclusive
right to fight at sea. "The essential basis of our
social institutions," said he, "is equality; to this touchstone
you must bring all parts of the government, both
military and civil. In the navy there exists an abuse, the
destruction of which is demanded by the Committee of
Public Safety by my mouth. There are in the navy troops
which bear the name of 'marine regiments.' Is this because
these troops have the <i>exclusive privilege</i> of defending
the republic upon the sea? Are we not <i>all</i> called
upon to fight for liberty? Why could not the victors of
Landau, of Toulon, go upon our fleets to show their courage
to Pitt, and lower the flag of George? This right cannot
be denied them; they themselves would claim it, were
not their arms serving the country elsewhere. Since they
cannot now enjoy it, we must at least give them the prospect
of using it."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>"Thus," says a French writer, "a marine artillerist, a
soldier trained in the difficult art of pointing a gun at sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and especially devoted to that service, became a kind of
aristocrat."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
None the less did the Convention, in those
days of the Terror, vote the change. "Take care," wrote
Admiral Kerguelen, "you need trained gunners to serve
guns at sea. Those on shore stand on a steady platform
and aim at fixed objects; those at sea, on the contrary, are
on a moving platform, and fire always, so to speak, on the
wing. The experience of the late actions should teach
you that our gunners are inferior to those of the enemy."
<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
The words of common sense could get no hearing in those
days of flighty ideas and excited imaginations. "How,"
asks La Gravière, "could these prudent words draw the
attention of republicans, more touched by the recollections
of Greece and Rome than by the glorious traditions of our
ancestors? Those were the days in which presumptuous
innovators seriously thought to restore to the oar its importance,
and to throw flying bridges on the decks of English
ships of the line, as the Romans did on board the
galleys of Carthage; candid visionaries, who with simplicity
summed up the titles of their mission in words
such as these, preserved among the archives of the Navy:
'Legislators, here are the outpourings of an ingenuous
patriot, who has for guide no other principle than that
of nature and a heart truly French.'"
<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The effects of this legislation were soon seen in the fighting
at sea. The British seventy-four, Alexander, fought
three French ships of her own size for two hours; the
average loss of each of the latter equalled that of the one
enemy. In June, 1795, twelve French ships-of-the-line
found themselves in presence of five British. There was
bad management in more ways than one, but five of the
French had three of the enemy under their fire for several
hours; only thirteen Englishmen were hurt, and no ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
so crippled as to be taken. A few days later the same
French fleet fell in with a British of somewhat superior
force. Owing to light airs and other causes, only a partial
engagement followed, in which eight British and twelve
French took part. The whole British loss was one hundred
and forty-four killed and wounded. Three French
ships struck, with a loss of six hundred and seventy; and
the nine others, which had been partially engaged, had a
total of two hundred and twenty-two killed and wounded.
In December, 1796, the British frigate Terpsichore met
the French Vestale, of equal force. The latter surrendered
after a sharp action of two hours, in which she
lost sixty-eight killed and wounded against the enemy's
twenty-two. This a French writer speaks of as a simple
artillery duel, unmarked by any manœuvres. These are
not instances chosen to prove a case, but illustrations
of the general fact, well known to contemporaries, that
the French gunnery was extremely bad. "In comparing
this war with the American," says Sir Howard Douglas,
"it is seen that, in the latter, the loss of English ships in
action with French of equal force, was much more considerable.
In the time of Napoleon, whole batteries of
ships-of-the-line were fired without doing more harm than
two pieces, well directed."</p>

<p>Nor was it only by direct legislation that the Assemblies
destroyed the efficiency of the crews. The neglect of discipline
and its bad results have before been mentioned. The
same causes kept working for many years, and the spirit
of insubordination, which sprang from revolutionary excess,
doubtless grew stronger as the crews found themselves
more and more under incapable officers, through the emigration
of their old leaders. As they threw off wholesome
restraint, they lost unavoidably in self-respect; and
the class of men to whom the confusion of an ill-ordered
ship was intolerable, as it becomes even to the humblest
seaman who has been used to regularity, doubtless did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
as the merchant officers of whom Villaret Joyeuse wrote.
They withdrew, under cover of the confusion of the times,
from the naval service. "The tone of the seamen is
wholly ruined," wrote Admiral Morard de Galles, on
March 22, 1793, a month after the declaration of war
with England: "if it does not change we can expect
nothing but reverses in action, even though we be superior
in force. The boasted ardor attributed to them" (by
themselves and national representatives) "stands only in
the words 'patriot,' 'patriotism,' which they are ever repeating,
and in shouts of 'Vive la nation! Vive la République!'
when they have been well flattered. No idea
of doing right or attending to their duties." The government
thought best not to interfere, for fear of alienating
the seamen. Morard de Galles's flag-ship, having carried
away her head-sails in a storm, tried unsuccessfully to
wear. "If I had had a crew such as we formerly had,"
wrote the admiral to the minister, "I would have used
means which would have succeeded; but, despite exhortations
and threats, I could not get thirty seamen on deck.
The army gunners and greater part of the marine troops
behaved better. They did what they were told; but the
seamen, even the petty officers, did not show themselves."
<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>In May, it being then open war, a mutiny broke out
when the Brest squadron was ordered to get under way.
To obtain obedience, the naval authorities had to call in
the city government and the Society of Friends of Liberty
and Equality. In June De Galles wrote again: "I have
sailed in the most numerous squadrons, but never in a
year did I see so many collisions as in the month this
squadron has been together." He kept the sea until
toward the end of August, when the fleet anchored in
Quiberon Bay, seventy-five miles south-east of Brest. The
Navy Department, which was only the mouthpiece of the
Committee of Public Safety, directed that the fleet should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
keep the sea till further orders. On the 13th of September,
news reached it of the insurrection of Toulon and the
reception there of the English fleet. Deputations from
different ships came to the admiral, headed by two midshipmen,
who demanded, with great insolence of manner,
that he should return to Brest, despite his orders. This
he firmly refused. The propositions of one of the midshipmen
were such that the admiral lost his temper. "I
called them," says he, "cowards, traitors, foes to the Revolution;
and, as they said they <i>would</i> get under way, I replied
(and at the instant I believed) that there were
twenty faithful ships which would fire on them if they
undertook any movements without my orders." The admiral
was mistaken as to the temper of the crews. Next
morning seven ships mast-headed their top-sails in readiness
to sail. He in person went on board, trying to bring
them back to obedience, but in vain. To mask his defeat
under a form of discipline, if discipline it could be called,
he consented to call a council of war, made up of one officer
and one seaman from each ship, to debate the question
of going back to Brest. This council decided to send deputies
to the representatives of the Convention, then on mission
in the department, and meanwhile to await further
orders from the government. This formality did not hide
the fact that power had passed from the commander-in-chief
appointed by the State to a council representing a
military mob.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The deputies from the ships found the commissioners of
the Convention, one of whom came to the fleet. Upon
consultation with the admiral, it appeared that twelve
ships out of twenty-one were in open mutiny, and four of
the other nine in doubt. As the fleet needed repairs, the
commissioner ordered its return to Brest. The mob thus
got its way, but the spirit of the government had changed.
In June the extreme revolutionary party had gained the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
upper hand in the State, and was no longer willing to
allow the anarchy which had hitherto played its game. The
Convention, under the rule of the Mountain, showed extreme
displeasure at the action of the fleet; and though
its anger fell upon the admirals and captains, many of
whom were deprived and some executed, decrees were issued
showing that rank insubordination would no longer
be tolerated. The government now felt strong.</p>

<p>The cruise of Morard de Galles is an instance, on a
large scale, of the state to which the navy had come in the
three years that had passed since mutiny had driven De
Rions from the service; but it by no means stood alone.
In the great Mediterranean naval port, Toulon, things
were quite as bad. "The new officers," says Chevalier,
"obtained no more obedience than the old; the crews became
what they had been made; they now knew only one
thing, to rise against authority. Duty and honor had become
to them empty words." It would be wearisome to
multiply instances and details. Out of their own country
such men were a terror rather to allies than foes. An
evidently friendly writer, speaking of the Mediterranean
fleet when anchored at Ajaccio in Corsica, says, under
date of December 31, 1792: "The temper of the fleet
and of the troops is excellent; only, it might be said,
there is not enough discipline. They came near hanging
one day a man who, the following day, was recognized as
very innocent of the charge made against him by the agitators.
The lesson, however, has not been lost on the
seamen, who, seeing the mis-steps into which these hangmen
by profession lead them, have denounced one of
them."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Grave disorders all the same took place, and two
Corsican National Guards were hanged by a mob of seamen
and soldiers from the fleet; but how extraordinary
must have been the feelings of the time when a critic
could speak so gingerly of, not to say praise, the temper
that showed itself in this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>While the tone and the military efficiency of officers and
crew were thus lowered, the material condition of both
ships and men was wretched. Incompetency and disorder
directed everywhere. There was lack of provisions, clothing,
timber, rigging, sails. In De Galles's fleet, though
they had just sailed, most of the ships needed repairs.
The crews counted very many sick, and they were besides
destitute of clothing. Although scurvy was raging, the
men, almost in sight of their own coast, were confined to
salt food. Of the Toulon squadron somewhat later, in
1795, we are told almost all the seamen deserted. "Badly
fed, scarcely clothed, discouraged by constant lack of success,
they had but one thought, to fly the naval service.
In September, ten thousand men would have been needed
to fill the complements of the Toulon fleet."
<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The country
was ransacked for seamen, who dodged the maritime
conscription as the British sailor of the day hid from the
press-gang.</p>

<p>After the action called by the British the Battle of
L'Orient, and by the French that of the Île de Groix, in
1795, the French fleet took refuge in L'Orient, where they
remained two months. So great was the lack of provisions
that the crews were given leave. When the ships were
again ready for sea "it was not an easy thing to make the
seamen come back; a decree was necessary to recall them
to the colors. Even so only a very small number returned,
and it was decided to send out singly, or at most by divisions,
the ships which were in the port. When they
reached Brest the crews were sent round to L'Orient by
land to man other ships. In this way the fleet sailed at
different dates in three divisions."
<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In the Irish expedition
of 1796, part of the failure in handling the ships is
laid to the men being benumbed with cold, because without
enough clothes. Pay was constantly in arrears. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
seamen, whatever might be their patriotism, could not
be tempted back to the discomforts and hardships of such
a service. Promises, threats, edicts, were all of no avail.
This state of things lasted for years. The civil commissioner
of the navy in Toulon wrote in 1798, concerning
the preparations for Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt:
"Despite the difficulties concerning supplies, they were
but a secondary object of my anxiety. To bring seamen
into the service fixed it entirely. I gave the commissioners
of the maritime inscription the most pressing orders;
I invited the municipalities, the commissioners of
the Directory, the commanders of the army, to second
them; and to assure the success of this general measure,
I sent with my despatches money to pay each seaman
raised a month's advance and conduct money. The inveterate
insubordination of seamen in most of the western
ports, their pronounced aversion to the service, making
almost null the effects of the maritime commissioners, I
sent a special officer from the port, firm and energetic," to
second their efforts; "at length after using every lawful
means, part of the western seamen have repaired to this
port. There are still many stragglers that are being pursued
unremittingly."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The chief causes for this trouble were the hardships and
the irregularity of pay, with the consequent sufferings to
their families. As late as 1801, Admiral Ganteaume drew
a moving picture of the state of the officers and men under
his command. "I once more call your attention to the
frightful state in which are left the seamen, unpaid for
fifteen months, naked or covered with rags, badly fed,
discouraged; in a word, sunk under the weight of the
deepest and most humiliating wretchedness. It would be
horrible to make them undertake, in this state, a long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
doubtless painful winter cruise."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Yet it was in this condition
he had come from Brest to Toulon in mid-winter.
At the same time the admiral said that the officers, receiving
neither pay nor table money, lived in circumstances
that lowered them in their own eyes and deprived them
of the respect of the crews. It was at about this time that
the commander of a corvette, taken by a British frigate,
made in his defence before the usual court-martial the following
statement: "Three fourths of the crew were sea-sick
from the time of leaving Cape Sepet until reaching
Mahon. Add to this, ill-will, and a panic terror which
seized my crew at the sight of the frigate. Almost all
thought it a ship-of-the-line. Add to this again, that they
had been wet through by the sea for twenty-four hours
without having a change of clothes, as I had only been
able to get ten spare suits for the whole ship's company."
<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
The quality of the crews, the conditions of their life, and
the reason why good seamen kept clear of the service, sufficiently
appear from these accounts. In the year of Trafalgar,
even, neither bedding nor clothing was regularly
issued to the crews.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Surprise will not be felt, when human beings were thus
neglected, that the needs of the inanimate ships were not
met. In the early part of the war it is not easy to say
whether the frequent accidents were due to bad handling
or bad outfit. In 1793, the escape of six sail-of-the-line,
under Admiral Van Stabel, from Lord Howe's fleet, is attributed
to superior sailing qualities of the hulls and the
better staying of the masts.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The next year, however, the
commissioner of the Convention who accompanied the
great ocean fleet, Jean Bon Saint-André, tried to account
for the many accidents which happened in good weather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
by charging the past reign with a deliberate purpose of
destroying the French navy. "This neglect," wrote he,
"like so many more, belonged to the system of ruining
the navy by carelessness and neglect of all the parts composing
it."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It was well known that Louis XVI. had
given special care to the material and development of the
service; nor is it necessary to seek any deeper cause for
the deterioration of such perishable materials than the disorders
of the five years since he practically ceased to reign.
From this time complaints multiply, and the indications of
the entire want of naval stores cannot be mistaken. To
this, rather than to the neglect of the dockyard officials in
Brest, was due the wretched condition of the fleet sent
in December, 1794, by the obstinacy of the Committee of
Public Safety, to make a mid-winter cruise in the Bay of
Biscay, the story of whose disasters is elsewhere told.
<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The expedition to Ireland in 1796 was similarly ill-prepared;
and indeed, with the British preponderance at sea
hampering trade, the embarrassment could scarcely fail to
grow greater. Spars carried away, rigging parted, sails
tore. Some ships had no spare sails. This, too, was a
mid-winter expedition, the squadron having sailed in December.
In 1798 the preparation of Bonaparte's Egyptian
expedition at Toulon met with the greatest difficulty. The
naval commissioner showed much zeal and activity, and
was fearless in taking upon himself responsibility; but the
fleet sailed for an unknown destination almost without
spare spars and rigging, and three of the thirteen were not
fit for sea. Two had been condemned the year before, and
on one they did not dare to put her regular battery. In
January, 1801, a squadron of seven sail-of-the-line left
Brest under Admiral Ganteaume, having the all-important
mission of carrying a reinforcement of five thousand
troops to the army in Egypt. Becoming discouraged,
whether rightly or wrongly, after entering the Mediterranean,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the admiral bore up for Toulon, where he anchored
after being at sea twenty-six days. Here is his report of
his fleet during and after this short cruise: "The 'Indivisible'
had lost two topmasts and had no spare one left. The
trestle-trees of the mainmast were sprung and could not
support the new topmast. The 'Desaix' had sprung her
bowsprit. The 'Constitution' and the 'Jean-Bart' were in
the same condition as the 'Indivisible,' neither having a
spare main-topmast after carrying away the others. Both
the 'Formidable' and the 'Indomptable,' on the night we
got under way, had an anchor break adrift. They had to
cut the cable; but both had their sides stove in at the
water-line, and could not be repaired at sea. Finally, all
the ships, without exception, were short of rope to a disquieting
extent, not having had, on leaving Brest, a single
spare coil; and the rigging in place was all bad, and in a
state to risk every moment the speed and safety of the
ships."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
It will be unnecessary to quote more of these
mishaps, in which lack of skill and bad equipment each
bore its part; nor need we try to disentangle the one
cause from the other.</p>

<p>Enough has now been said to show the general state of
the French navy in the last ten years of the eighteenth
century. The time and space thus used have not been
wasted, for these conditions, which continued under the
empire, were as surely the chief cause of the continuous
and overwhelming overthrow of that navy, as the ruin of
the French and Spanish sea-power, culminating at Trafalgar,
was a principal factor in the final result sealed at
Waterloo. Great Britain will be seen to enter the war
allied with many of the nations of Europe against France.
One by one the allies drop away, until the island kingdom,
with two-fifths the population of France and a disaffected
Ireland, stands alone face to face with the mighty onset of
the Revolution. Again and again she knits the coalitions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
which are as often cut asunder by the victorious sword of
the French army. Still she stands alone on the defensive,
until the destruction of the combined fleets at Trafalgar,
and the ascendency of her own navy, due to the immense
physical loss and yet more to the moral annihilation of
that of the enemy, enable her to assume the offensive in
the peninsula after the Spanish uprising,—an offensive
based absolutely upon her control of the sea. Her presence
in Portugal and Spain keeps festering that Spanish
ulcer which drained the strength of Napoleon's empire.
As often before, France, contending with Germany, had
Spain again upon her back.</p>

<p>There still remains to consider briefly the state of the
other navies which bore a part in the great struggle; and
after that, the strategic conditions of the sea war, in its
length and breadth, at the time it began.</p>

<p>The British navy was far from being in perfect condition;
and it had no such administrative prescription upon
which to fall back as France always had in the regulations
and practice of Colbert and his son. In the admiralty and
the dockyards, at home and abroad, there was confusion
and waste, if not fraud. As is usual in representative governments,
the military establishments had drooped during
ten years of peace. But, although administration lacked
system, and agents were neglectful or dishonest, the navy
itself, though costing more than it should, remained vigorous;
the possessor of actual, and yet more of reserved,
strength in the genius and pursuits of the people,—in a
continuous tradition, which struck its roots far back in a
great past,—and above all, in a body of officers, veterans
of the last, and some of yet earlier wars, still in the prime
of life for the purposes of command, and steeped to the
core in those professional habits and feelings which, when
so found in the chief, transmit themselves quickly to the
juniors. As the eye of the student familiar with naval
history glances down the lists of admirals and captains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
in 1793, it recognizes at once the names of those who
fought under Keppel, Rodney, and Howe, linked with those
who were yet to win fame as the companions of Hood,
Jervis, Nelson, and Collingwood.</p>

<p>To this corps of officers is to be added, doubtless, a
large number of trained seamen, who, by choice, remained
in the navy under the reduced peace complement; a nucleus
round which could be rapidly gathered and organized
all the sea-faring population fit for active service. The
strength of Great Britain, however, lay in her great body
of merchant seamen; and the absence of so many of these
on distant voyages was always a source of embarrassment
when manning a fleet in the beginning of a war. The
naval service was also generally unpopular with the sailor;
to whom, as to his officer, the rigid yoke of discipline was
hard to bear until the neck was used to it. Hence, in the
lack of any system similar to the French maritime inscription,
Great Britain resorted to the press; a method
which, though legally authorized, was stained in execution
by a lawlessness and violence strange in a people that so
loved both law and freedom. Even so, with both press-gang
and free enlistment, the navy, as a whole, was always
shorthanded in a great war, so that men of all nations
were received and welcomed; much very bad native material
was also accepted. "Consider," wrote Collingwood,
"with such a fleet as we have now, how large a proportion
of the crews of the ships are miscreants of every description,
and capable of every crime. And when those predominate
what evils may we not dread from the demoniac
councils and influence of such a mass of mischief."
<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The condition of the seamen on board left much to be
desired. The pay had not been increased since the days
of Charles II., although the prices of all the necessaries
of life had risen thirty per cent. The exigencies of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
service, combined with the fear of desertion, led to very
close enforced confinement to the ship, even in home
ports; men were long unable to see their families. The
discipline, depending upon the character of the captain,
too little defined and limited by law, varied greatly in
different ships; while some were disorganized by undue
leniency, in others punishment was harsh and tyrannical.
On the other hand, there was a large and growing class of
officers, both among the sterner and the laxer disciplinarians,
who looked upon the health and well-being of the
crew as the first of their duties and interests; and better
sanitary results have perhaps never been reached, certainly
never in proportion to the science of the day, than under
Jervis, Nelson, Collingwood, and their contemporaries, in
fleets engaged in the hardest, most continuous service,
under conditions of monotony and isolation generally unfavorable
to health. Nelson, during a cruise in which he
passed two years without leaving his ship even for another,
often speaks with pride, almost with exultation, of the
health of his crews. After his pursuit of Villeneuve's
fleet to the West Indies, he writes: "We have lost neither
officer nor man by sickness since we left the Mediterranean,"
a period of ten weeks. The number of men in his
ships must have been near seven thousand. Both French
and Spaniards of the fleet he pursued were very sickly.
"They landed a thousand sick at Martinique, and buried
full that number during their stay."
<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Collingwood writes:
"I have not let go an anchor for fifteen months, and on
the first day of the year had not a sick-list in the ship—not
one man."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
And again a year later: "Yet, with all
this sea-work, never getting fresh beef nor a vegetable, I
have not one sick man in my ship. Tell that to Doctor ——."
"His flag-ship had usually eight hundred men;
was, on one occasion, more than a year and a half without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
going into port, and during the whole of that time never
had more than six, and generally only four, on her sick-list."
<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Such results show beyond dispute that the crews
were well clothed, well fed, and well cared for.</p>

<p>Amid ship's companies of such mixed character, and
suffering during the early years of the war from real and
severe grievances, it was to be expected that acts of mutiny
should occur. Such there were, rivalling, if not surpassing,
in extent, those which have been told of the French
navy. They also received intelligent guidance at the
hands of a class of men, of higher educational acquirements
than the average seaman, who, through drunkenness,
crime, or simple good-for-nothingness, had found
their way on board ship. The feature which distinguished
these revolts from those of the French was the
spirit of reasonableness and respect for law which at the
first marked their proceedings; and which showed how
deeply the English feeling for law, duty and discipline,
had taken hold of the naval seamen. Their complaints,
unheeded when made submissively, were at once allowed
to be fair when mutiny drew attention to them. The
forms of discipline were maintained by men who refused
to go to sea before their demands were allowed, unless
"the enemy's fleet should put to sea;"
<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and respect to
officers was enjoined, though some who were obnoxious
for severity were sent ashore. One very signal instance
is given of military sympathy with obedience to orders,
though at their own expense. A lieutenant, having shot
one of several mutineers, was seized by the others, who
made ready to hang him, and he stood actually under the
yard-arm with the halter round his neck; but upon the
admiral saying he himself was responsible, having given
orders to the officer in accordance with his own from the
Admiralty, the seamen stopped, asked to see the orders,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and, having satisfied themselves of their terms, abandoned
their purpose.</p>

<p>Captain Brenton, the naval historian, was watch-officer
on board a ship that for many days was in the hands of
mutineers. He says, "The seamen, generally speaking,
throughout the mutiny conducted themselves with a degree
of humanity highly creditable, not only to themselves, but
to the national character. They certainly tarred and feathered
the surgeon of a ship at the Nore, but he had been
five weeks drunk in his cabin and had neglected the care of
his patients; this was therefore an act which Lord Bacon
would have called 'wild justice.' The delegates of the
'Agamemnon'" (his own ship) "showed respect to every
officer but the captain; him, after the first day, they never
insulted but rather treated with neglect; they asked permission
of the lieutenants to punish a seaman, who, from
carelessness or design, had taken a dish of meat belonging
to the ward-room and left his own, which was honestly
and civilly offered in compensation."
<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Still, though begun
under great provocation and marked at first by such
orderly procedure, the fatal effects of insubordination once
indulged long remained, as in a horse that has once felt
his strength; while the self-control and reasonableness of
demand which distinguished the earlier movements lost
their sway. The later mutinies seriously endangered the
State, and the mutinous spirit survived after the causes
which palliated it had been removed.</p>

<p>In meeting the needs of so great and widely scattered a
naval force, even with the best administration and economy,
there could not but be great deficiencies; and the
exigencies of the war would not permit ships to be recalled
and refitted as often as the hard cruising properly required.
Still, by care and foresight, the equipment of the fleet was
maintained in sufficient and serviceable condition. In the
year 1783 a plan was adopted "of setting apart for every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
sea-going ship a large proportion of her furniture and
stores, as well as of stocking the magazines at the several
dockyards with imperishable stores."
<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The readiness thus
sought was tested, and also bettered, by the two partial
armaments of 1790 against Spain and of 1791 against Russia;
so that, when orders to arm were received in 1793, in
a very few weeks the ships-of-the-line in commission were
increased from twenty-six to fifty-four, and the whole number
of ships of all sizes from one hundred and thirty-six
to over two hundred. The same care and foresight was
continued into the war. It was as much an object with
Great Britain to hinder the carriage of naval stores from
the Baltic to France as to get them herself, and there was
reason to fear that her seizure of ships so laden and bound
to France would, as before, bring on trouble with the
northern States. "In 1796 the quantity of naval stores
remaining on hand was too small to afford a hope of their
lasting to the end of the war; but the government, foreseeing
that a rupture must ensue, provided an abundant
supply of materials for naval equipment; ship timber was
imported from the Adriatic, masts and hemp from North
America, and large importations were made from the Baltic.
The number of British ships which passed the Sound
in one year was forty-five hundred, chiefly laden with naval
stores, corn, tallow, hides, hemp, and iron. At the same
time the most rigid economy was enforced in the dockyards
and on board ships of war."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>A bare sufficiency—to be eked out with the utmost
care, turning everything to account, working old stuff up
into new forms—was the economic condition of the British
cruiser of the day. Under such conditions the knack
of the captain and officers made a large part of the efficiency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of the ship. "Some," wrote Collingwood, "who
have the foresight to discern what our first difficulty will
be, support and provide their ships as by enchantment;
while others, less provident, would exhaust a dockyard and
still be in want." Of one he said: "He should never sail
without a storeship in company;" while of Troubridge
Nelson wrote that "he was as full of resources as his old
'Culloden' was of defects." A lieutenant of the day mentions
feelingly the anxieties felt on dark nights and in
heavy weather off the enemy's coast, "doubting this brace
or that tack," upon which the safety of the ship might
depend. The correspondence of Nelson often mentions
this dearth of stores.</p>

<p>The condition of the two navies in these various respects
being as described, their comparative strength in mere
numbers is given by the British naval historian James,
whose statement bears every mark of careful study and
accuracy. After making every deduction, the British had
one hundred and fifteen ships-of-the-line, and the French
seventy-six, when war was declared. The number of guns
carried by these ships was respectively 8718 and 6002;
but the author claims that, in consequence of the heavier
metal of the French guns, the aggregate weight of broadside,
undoubtedly the fairest method of comparison, of the
line-of-battle in the two navies was 88,957 pounds against
73,957,—a preponderance of one sixth in favor of Great
Britain.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
This statement is explicitly accepted by the
French admiral, La Gravière,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and does not differ materially
from other French accounts of the numerical strength
of that navy at the fall of the monarchy.</p>

<p>The navy of Spain then contained seventy-six ships-of-the-line,
of which fifty-six were in good condition.
<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Particular
and detailed accounts are wanting, but it may
safely be inferred from many indications scattered along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the paths of naval records that the valid strength fell very,
very far below this imposing array of ships. The officers
as a body were inexpert and ignorant; the administration
of the dockyards partook of the general shiftlessness of
the decaying kingdom; the crews contained few good seamen
and were largely swept out of the streets, if not out
of the jails. "The Spaniards at this time," says La Gravière,
"were no longer substantial enemies. At the battle
of St. Vincent there were scarcely sixty to eighty seamen
in each ship-of-the-line. The rest of the crews were
made up of men wholly new to the sea, picked up a few
months before in the country or in the jails, and who, by
the acknowledgment of even English historians, when ordered
to go aloft, fell on their knees, crying that they
would rather be killed on the spot than meet certain death
in trying so perilous a service."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>"The Dons," wrote Nelson in 1793, after a visit to Cadiz,
"may make fine ships,—they cannot, however, make
men. They have four first-rates in commission at Cadiz,
and very fine ships, but shockingly manned. I am certain
if our six barges' crews, who are picked men, had got on
board of one of them, they would have taken her." "If
the twenty-one ships-of-the-line which we are to join off
Barcelona are no better manned than those at Cadiz, much
service cannot be expected of them, although, as to ships,
I never saw finer men-of-war."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> A few weeks later he
fell in with the twenty-one. "The Dons did not, after
several hours' trial, form anything that could be called a
line-of-battle ahead. However, the Spanish admiral sent
down two frigates, acquainting Lord Hood that, as his
fleet was sickly nineteen hundred men, he was going to
Cartagena. The captain of the frigate said 'it was no
wonder they were sickly <i>for they had been sixty days at
sea</i>.' This speech appeared to us ridiculous, for, from the
circumstance of our having been longer than that time at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
sea do we attribute our getting healthy. It has stamped
with me the measure of their nautical abilities; long may
they remain in their present state."
<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In 1795, when
Spain had made peace with France, he wrote, "I know the
French long since offered Spain peace for fourteen ships-of-the-line
fully stored. I take for granted not manned,
as that would be the readiest way to lose them again."
"Their fleet is ill-manned and worse officered, I believe;
and besides they are slow." "From the event of Spain
making peace much may be looked for,—perhaps a war
with that country; if so, their fleet (if no better than
when our allies) will be soon done for."
<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Captain Jahleel Brenton, a distinguished British officer
of that day, being in Cadiz on duty before the war, sought
and obtained permission to return to England in a Spanish
ship-of-the-line, the "St. Elmo," with the express object of
seeing the system of their service. He says, "This ship
had been selected as one in the best state of discipline in
the Spanish navy to be sent to England. She was commanded
by Don Lorenzo Goycochea, a gallant seaman who
had commanded one of the junto ships destroyed before
Gibraltar in 1782. I had, during this voyage, an opportunity
of appreciating Spanish management at sea. When
the ship was brought under double-reefed topsails, it was
considered superfluous to lay the cloth for dinner; I was
told by the captain that not one officer would be able to
sit at table, all being sea-sick, but that he had ordered dinner
to be got ready in his own cabin for himself and me.
It was the custom in the Spanish navy for the captain and
officers to mess together in the ward-room. We had
thenceforth a very comfortable meal together whenever
the weather prevented a general meeting. As the safe
arrival of this ship was deemed of great importance (she
carried the Nootka Sound indemnity money), she had on
board an English pilot to enable her to approach the coast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of England in safety. A few nights before our arrival at
Falmouth, the ship, having whole sails and topping sails,
was taken aback in a heavy squall from the north-east,
and I was awoke by the English pilot knocking at my
cabin door, calling out,'Mr. Brenton! Mr. Brenton! rouse
out, sir; here is the ship running away with these Spaniards!'
When I got on deck I found this literally the
case. She was 'running away' at the rate of twelve knots,
and everything in confusion; she was indeed, to use the
ludicrous expression of a naval captain 'all adrift, like a
French post-chaise.' It required some hours to get things
to rights."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Napoleon, in 1805, ordered Admiral Villeneuve to count
two Spanish ships as equal to one French; and the latter
certainly were not equal, ship for ship, to the British. It
is only fair to add that he said of the Spanish crews,
speaking of Calder's action, that they fought like lions.</p>

<p>Holland, first the ally and afterwards the enemy of
Great Britain in the war, had forty-nine ships-of-the-line,
but, owing to the shoalness of her waters, they were mostly
of light burden; many would not have found a place in a
British line-of-battle. The frigates were also of small
force. The condition of the ships being, besides, bad, the
Dutch navy was not an important factor on either side.
<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Portugal and Naples had, the one six, the other four,
ships-of-the-line, which, during the early years of the war,
offered a respectable support to the British Mediterranean
fleet;<a name="FNanchor_66a_66a" id="FNanchor_66a_66a"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
but the advance of the French under Bonaparte
into the two peninsulas reduced these States to neutrality
before the end of the century.</p>

<p>The fleets of the Baltic powers and of Turkey played no
part in the war which would, at this time, require a particular
consideration of their strength.</p>

</div>

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">The General Political and Strategic Conditions, and the
Events of 1793.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap">THE declaration of war against Great Britain was followed,
on the part of the National Convention, by an
equally formal pronouncement against Spain, on the 7th
of March, 1793. Thus was completed the chain of enemies
which, except on the mountain frontier of Switzerland,
surrounded the French republic by land and sea.</p>

<p>It is necessary to summarize the political and military
condition, to take account of the strategic situation at this
moment when general hostilities were opening, in order
to follow intelligently the historical narrative of their
course, and to appreciate critically the action of the nations
engaged, both separately and, also,—in the case
of the allies,—regarded as a combined whole.</p>

<p>The enemies of France were organized governments,
with constitutions of varying strength and efficiency, but
all, except that of Great Britain, were part of an order
of things that was decaying and ready to vanish away.
They belonged to, and throughout the Revolutionary and
Napoleonic wars were hampered by, a past whose traditions
of government, of social order, and of military administration,
were violently antagonized by the measures
into which France had been led by pushing to extremes
the philosophical principles of the eighteenth century. But
while thus at one in abhorring, as rulers, a movement
whose contagion they feared, they were not otherwise in
harmony. The two most powerful on the continent, Austria
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and Prussia, had alternately, in a not remote past,
sided with France as her ally; each in turn had sustained
open and prolonged hostilities with the other, and they
were still jealous rivals for preponderance in Germany.
They entered the present war as formal allies; but were
unable, from mutual distrust and their military traditions,
to act in concert, or to take advantage of the disorganized
condition into which France had fallen, and from which
the despotism of the Convention had not yet raised her.
Divergent lines of operations were imposed upon them, not
by military expediency, but by the want of any unifying
motive which could overcome their divergent ambitions.
The smaller States of Germany followed the two great
powers, seeking each from day to day its own safety and
its own advantage in the troubled times through which
Europe was passing. Several of them had associations
with France as a powerful neighbor, who in the past had
supported them against the overbearing pretensions of the
great German monarchies. With the Convention and its
social levelling they could have no sympathy, but when a
settled government succeeded the throes of the Revolution
the old political bias asserted itself against the more recent
social prejudice, and these weaker bodies again fell naturally
under French control.</p>

<p>Spain under good government has, and at that crisis
still more had, a military situation singularly fitted to give
her weight in the councils of Europe. Compact and symmetrical
in shape, with an extensive seaboard not deficient
in good harbors, her physical conformation and remoteness
from the rest of the Continent combined to indicate
that her true strength was to be found in a powerful navy,
for which also her vast colonial system imperiously called.
Her maritime advantages were indeed diminished by the
jog which Portugal takes out of her territory and coast
line, and by the loss of Gibraltar. Lisbon, in the hands
of an enemy, interposes between the arsenals of Ferrol and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Cadiz, as Gibraltar does between the latter and Cartagena.
But there was great compensation in the extent of her
territory, in her peninsular formation, and in the difficult
character of her only continental frontier, the Pyrenees.
Her position is defensively very strong; and whenever
events make France the centre of European interest, as
they did in 1793, and as the genius of that extraordinary
country continually tends to make her, the external action
of Spain becomes doubly interesting. So far as natural
advantages go, her military situation at the opening of the
French revolution may be defined by saying that she controlled
the Mediterranean, and menaced the flank and rear
of France by land. Despite Gibraltar, her action was to
determine whether the British navy should or should not
enter the Mediterranean—whether the wheat of Barbary
and Sicily should reach the hungry people of southern
France—whether the French fleet should leave Toulon—whether
the French army could advance against the Germans
and Piedmont, feeling secure as to the country behind
it, then seething with revolt. The political condition
of Italy, divided like Germany into many petty States, but
unlike Germany in having no powerful centres around
which to gather, left to Spain, potentially, the control of the
Mediterranean. These advantages were all thrown away
by bad government and inefficient military institutions.
The navy of Spain was the laughing-stock of Europe;
her finances depended upon the colonies, and consequently
upon control of the sea, which she had not;
while, between an embarrassed treasury and poor military
administration, her army, though at first under respectable
leadership, made little impression upon the yet unorganized
levies of France, and an abject peace soon closed an
ignominious war.</p>

<p>The path of Great Britain, as soon as she had determined
to enter the war, was comparatively clear, being
indicated alike by the character of her military strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and by her history during the past century. Since the
days of Charles II. she had been at times the ally, at times
the enemy, of Austria, of Prussia, and of Holland; she had,
in her frequent wars, found Spain at times neutral, at
times hostile, in neither case a very powerful factor; but,
under all circumstances, France had been her enemy,
sometimes secret, usually open. Steeped in this traditional
hostility, both the British government and nation with
single eye fastened upon France as the great danger, and
were not diverted from this attitude of concentrated purpose
by any jealousy of the more powerful among their
allies. Spain alone might have been an unwelcome rival,
as well as a powerful support, upon the watery plain which
Great Britain claimed as her own dominion. Spanish
ships of war were numerous; but the admiralty soon saw
that the Spanish navy, from the poor quality of its officers
and men, could not seriously menace British preponderance
upon the ocean, although at times it might be an
awkward embarrassment, and even more so as a suspicious
ally than as an open foe. The co-operation of the
two navies, however, at the opening of the war effectually
secured for the time the control of the Mediterranean and
of the approaches to southern France.</p>

<p>Russia, although declaring openly against the French
Revolution, took no active part in the early military operations,
except by a convention made with Great Britain on
the 25th of March, 1793, to interdict the trade of France
with the Baltic in grain and naval stores, as a means of
forcing her to peace. Russia was then busily engaged
with her projects against Poland, and a few days later, on
the 9th of April, 1793, an imperial ukase was issued incorporating
parts of that kingdom with the empire. This,
with the Prussian decree of March 25, consummated the
second partition of Poland,—the result of a series of aggressions
by the two powers that had extended over the
past two years, and the intermediate step to the final partition
in 1795.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>The smaller European States trimmed their course as
best they could in the great convulsion which, far beyond
most wars, left little room for neutrality. Sweden and
Denmark strove hard to keep out of the turmoil and to
retain the commercial advantages reaped by neutral flags
in maritime wars. Their distance from the scene of the
earlier strifes, and the peninsular position of Sweden, enabled
them long to avoid actual hostilities; but the concurrence
of Russia with Great Britain, in the latter's
traditional unwillingness to concede neutral claims, deprived
the smaller Baltic powers of the force necessary
to maintain their contentions. Holland, as of old, was
divided between French and British parties; but the latter,
under the headship of the House of Orange, in 1793, held
the reins of government and directed the policy of the
State in accordance with the treaty of defensive alliance
made with Great Britain in 1788. The ultimate policy of
the United Provinces depended upon the fortune of the
war. As France or her enemies triumphed, so would the
party in the State favorable to the victor be retained in,
or restored to, power. Neutrality was impossible to an
open continental country, lying so near such a great conflagration;
but, not to speak of the immediate dangers
threatened by the attitude of the French Convention and
its decrees of November 19 and December 15, Holland,
with her vast colonial system, had more to fear from the
navy of Great Britain, which had no rival, than from the
armies of France which, in 1793, were confronted by
the most powerful military States in Europe. At this
time the United Provinces held, besides Java and other
possessions in the far East, various colonies in the West
Indies and South America, the island of Ceylon and the
Cape of Good Hope. The last two alone Great Britain
has finally retained; but all of them, as years went by,
passed by conquest into her hands after Holland, in 1795,
became the dependent of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Portugal retained her traditional alliance with Great
Britain, and so became a point of supreme importance
when the secession of Spain to France compelled the British
navy to leave the Mediterranean. The formal connection
between the two countries was for a short time
severed by the genius and power of Napoleon; but, at the
uprising of Spain in 1808, the old sentiment, unbroken,
resumed its sway, and Portugal became the base of the
British army, as in an earlier day she had been the secure
haven of the British fleet.</p>

<p>In northern Italy the extent of Piedmont and its contiguity
to the Austrian duchies of Milan and Mantua gave
the means of forming a powerful focus of resistance to
their common enemy, the French republic, around which
the smaller Italian States might feel secure to rally; but
the sluggishness and jealousies of the two governments
prevented the vigorous, combined action which alone
could cope with the energy impressed by the Convention
upon its men. In the centre of the peninsula, the Pope
inevitably threw his immense spiritual influence, as well
as such temporal power as he could exercise, against the
revolution; while, in the south, the Bourbon kingdom of
the Two Sicilies, with its capital at Naples, was chiefly
controlled by the queen, herself a sister of Marie Antoinette.
The military strength of this kingdom, like that
of Spain, was rendered contemptible by miserable administration,
and was further neutralized by its remoteness
from the seats of actual war; but the bias of the monarchy
was undoubted. Like all weak and corrupt governments,
it shuffled and equivocated under pressure and was false
when the pressure was removed; but, so far as it could,
it favored the allied cause and was a useful base to the
British fleet in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In the eastern Mediterranean, the Turkish empire was
not then the element of recognized critical hazard to the
whole European system which it has since become; but its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
territorial limits were far wider than they now are. Extending
on the north to the Save and the Danube, Turkey
held also beyond the river Wallachia and Moldavia to the
banks of the Dniester, and, on the south, the present kingdom
of Greece. The islands of the Archipelago, with
Crete and Cyprus, also belonged to her. Syria and Egypt likewise
acknowledged the authority of the Porte, but in both
the submission yielded was only nominal; the former,
under Djezzar Pasha, and the latter, under the Mamelukes,
were practically independent countries. At the outbreak
of the French Revolution Turkey had sunk to the
lowest pitch of disorganization and impotence; and her
rulers, keenly feeling her condition and her danger from
Russia, sought to avoid entanglement in the troubles of
western Europe, from which their great enemy kept itself
free. In this they were successful until Bonaparte, by his
attack upon Egypt, forced them from their security and
aroused Great Britain and Europe to their common interest
in the East.</p>

<p>The islands of the western Mediterranean had not only
the importance common to all members of that geographical
family in naval wars, nor yet only that due to their
intrinsic values. In so narrow a sheet of water each possessed
an added strategic weight due to its nearness, either
to some part of the mainland or to some one of the maritime
routes traversing the sea. The influence thus exerted
would fall naturally into the hands of the nation
which, by controlling the water, controlled the communications
of the island; but this statement, though generally
true, is subject to limitations. The narrowness of the
belts of water, or, to use the military phrase, the shortness
of the communications from land to land, made evasion
comparatively easy. No navy, however powerful, can with
certainty stop an intercourse requiring only a night's run,
and which, therefore, can be carried on by very many
small vessels, instead of having to be concentrated into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a few large ones; and this was doubly true in the days of
sail, when the smaller could have recourse to the oar
while the larger lay becalmed. Thus the British found it
impossible to prevent French partisans from passing into
Corsica in 1796, when the victories of Bonaparte had
placed the French army in Leghorn; and at a later day
the emperor succeeded, though with infinite trouble, in
sending re-enforcements and supplies from southern Italy
to his garrison in Corfu, upon which his far-reaching genius
hoped, in a distant future, to base a yet further extension
of power in the East. These instances, however, were
but the exception, and on the small scale demanded by the
other conditions; for the garrison of Corfu was few in
number, and the French found the Corsicans friendly. As
the communications lengthened, the influence of Sea-Power
asserted itself. It was found impossible to relieve Malta,
or even to extricate the large vessels blockaded there;
and the French army in Egypt remained isolated until
forced to surrender, despite the efforts, the uncontrolled
power, and the strong personal interest of Bonaparte in
the success of an occupation for which he was primarily
responsible. So also the narrow strip which separates
Sicily from Italy withstood the French arms; not because
it was impossible to send many detachments across, but
because, to support them in a hostile country, with such
insecure communications, was an undertaking more hazardous
than was justified by the possible advantages.</p>

<p>The political distribution in 1793 of the islands of the
western Mediterranean was as follows. The most eastern,
known as the Ionian islands, extending southward from
the entrance of the Adriatic along the coast of Greece,
from Corfu to Cerigo, were in possession of Venice. When
the ancient republic fell before the policy of Bonaparte, in
1797, the islands passed to France and began that circulation
from owner to owner which ended in 1863 with their
union to Greece. Sicily formed part of the kingdom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the Two Sicilies. It became the refuge of that monarchy
from the arms of France, and, by its fertility and the use
of its ports, was a resource to Great Britain throughout
the Napoleonic period. Malta was still in the hands of
the Knights of St. John. Of immense military importance,
from its geographical position and intrinsic strength, its
transfer, through the medium of France, into the hands
of the greatest of naval powers was due to Bonaparte. It
is, perhaps, the greatest of Mediterranean strategic positions,
Egypt being rather interoceanic than Mediterranean;
but, being of scant resources, its utility is measured
by the power of the fleet which it subserves. Its fate
when in the hands of France, the history of Port Mahon
in the hands of Great Britain, nay, even the glorious and
successful resistance of Gibraltar, give warning that the
fleet depends less upon Malta than Malta upon the fleet.</p>

<p>Sardinia gave its name to the kingdom of which Piedmont,
forming the Italian frontier of France, was the actual
seat, and Turin the capital. Amid the convulsions
of the period, the royal family, driven from the mainland,
found an obscure refuge in this large but backward island.
France could not touch it; Great Britain needed nothing
but the hospitality of its harbors. In Maddalena Bay, at
its northern extremity, Nelson found an anchorage strategically
well-placed for watching the Toulon fleet, and
possessing that great desideratum for a naval position,
two exits, one or other of which was available in any
wind. The Balearic islands were in the hands of Spain.
The maritime importance of the other members of the
group was dwarfed by that of Minorca, which contained
the harbor, exceptionally good for the Mediterranean, of
Port Mahon. Like Malta, though not to the same extent,
the fate of Port Mahon depends ultimately upon the sea.
The British took possession of the island in 1798, but
restored it at the peace of Amiens. In the later hostilities
with Spain, from 1804 to 1808, they appear not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to have coveted it. Maddalena Bay, though a less agreeable
and convenient anchorage than Mahon, is far better
fitted for prompt military movement, the prime requisite
in the clear and sound judgment of Nelson.</p>

<p>Of the greater islands there remains to give account
only of Corsica. This was a recent acquisition of France,
received from Genoa in 1769, somewhat contrary to the
wish of the people, who would have preferred independence.
They were certainly not yet assimilated to the
French, and there existed among them a party traditionally
well-inclined to Great Britain. The preponderance of
this or of the other national preference would be decisive
of the final political connection; for if the British navy did
control the surrounding sea, it was unable, as before said,
entirely to isolate the island and so to compel an unwilling
submission. On the other hand, France could not introduce
any considerable body of troops, in the face of the
hostile ships; and her standard, if raised, would depend
for support upon the natives. In 1793, there was at the
head of affairs the old leader of the struggle for independence,
Paoli, who had passed many years in exile in England
and had been recalled to the island by the National
Assembly; but the excesses of the later days had shaken
his allegiance to France, and the commissioners sent by
the Convention into Corsica made themselves obnoxious to
him and to the people. Denounced by the republicans of
Toulon, Paoli was summoned to the bar of the Convention
in April, 1793. The Revolutionary Tribunal had then been
constituted, the Reign of Terror was begun; and Paoli,
instead of complying, summoned the deputies from all the
cities and communes of Corsica. These met in May and
sustained him in his opposition; the revolt spread through
the island, and the Commissioners with their handful of
adherents were shut up in a few of the coast towns.</p>

<p>Amid these surroundings stood, in the spring of 1793,
the terrible and awe-inspiring figure of the French Revolution.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
The Corsican revolt against the Convention reflected
but faintly the passions agitating that body itself,
and which were rapidly dividing all France into hostile
camps. The four months following the execution of the
king were one long strife between the party of the Gironde
and the Jacobins; but the revolutionary fury demanded an
expression more vigorous and more concentrated than
could be had from a contest of parties in a popular assembly.
The Girondists, men of lofty sentiment rather
than of energetic action, steadily lost ground in the capital
and in the legislative body, though retaining the allegiance
of the provinces, with which they were identified.
Embittered words and feelings took material shape in acts
as violent as themselves. On the 9th of March was decreed
the Revolutionary Tribunal, the great instrument of
the Terror, from whose decisions there was no appeal.
On the 13th of the same month, La Vendée rose for its
long and bloody struggle in the royal cause. On the 18th,
the Army of the North, which only four weeks before had
invaded Holland, was signally defeated at Neerwinden,
and its general, Dumouriez, the victor of Valmy and
Jemappes, the most successful leader the war had yet
produced, was forced to retreat upon France. On the
30th, he evacuated the Austrian Netherlands, the prize of
the last campaign, and his army took positions within the
frontiers, upon which the enemy advanced. On the 1st of
April, Dumouriez, long since violently dissatisfied with
the course of the Convention, arrested the four commissioners
and the minister of war that had been sent to his
headquarters. The next day he delivered them to the
Austrians; and on the 4th, finding that the blind attachment
of his army could no longer be depended upon, he
completed his treason by flying to the enemy.</p>

<p>While disorganization, treason, and fear were spreading
throughout France, from the capital to the frontiers, and
seemed about to culminate in universal anarchy, an important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
measure was adopted, destined eventually to restore
discipline and order, though at the expense of much
suffering. On the 6th of April the Committee of Public
Safety was reconstituted. Composed previously of twenty-five
members who met in open session, it was now reduced
to nine, a more manageable body, who sat in secret. To
it was given authority over the ministers, and it was empowered
to take all measures necessary for the general
defence. The republic was thus provided with an efficient,
though despotic, executive power which it had before
lacked. The creature of the Convention, it was destined
soon to become its master; being, as a French historian
has aptly termed it, "a dictatorship with nine heads."</p>

<p>Time was still needed for the new authority to make
itself felt, and the strife between the parties waxed more
and more bitter. On the 15th of April the city of Lyon
demanded permission to investigate the conduct of the
municipality appointed by the Jacobin commissioners.
The request, being denied, became the signal for civil
war. On the 26th of May the "sections" of the city
rose against the mayor. At the same time the scenes in
Paris and in the Convention were becoming more and
more tumultuous, and on the 31st the sections of the capital
also rose, but against the Girondists. After two days
of strife in the streets and in the legislative halls, the Convention
decreed the arrest, at their own houses, of thirty-two
members of the party. Thus, on the 2d of June,
1793, fell the Girondists, but their fall was followed by
the revolt of their partisans throughout France. Marseille,
Toulon, Bordeaux and Lyon all declared against the Convention;
and movements in the same direction were manifested
in Normandy and Brittany. In the western provinces,
however, the attempts at resistance were chilled
among the republicans by the proximity of the royalist
insurrection in La Vendée. They were forced to reflect
that armed opposition to the Convention, even as mutilated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
by the events of June 2, was a virtual alliance with
royalism. In Bordeaux, likewise, the movement, though
prolonged for some weeks, did not take shape in vigorous
action. Words, not arms, were the weapons used; and
the Girondist representatives were forced to fly the very
department from which they took their name.</p>

<p>In the east and south conditions were far more threatening.
The rising of the sections in Lyon had been
followed by fighting in the streets on the 29th of May,
and the triumphant party, after the events of June 2, refused
to acknowledge the Convention. The latter sought
to gain over the city peaceably; but its overtures were
rejected, a departmental army was formed, and the leading
member of the Jacobin party formally tried and executed.
The Lyonnese also stopped supplies being carried
to the Army of the Alps. On the 12th of July a decree
was issued to reduce the place by force. The troops of the
Convention appeared before it in the latter part of the
month; but resistance was firm and well organized, and
the siege dragged, while at the same time the departments
of the south in general rejected the authority of the central
government. The two seaboard cities, Marseille and
Toulon, entered into correspondence with Lord Hood, commanding
the British fleet, who arrived off the coast of
Provence in the middle of August, 1793. The party of
the Convention, favored by that want of vigor which characterized
most of the measures of their opponents, got
possession of Marseille before the treason was consummated;
but in Toulon, which had long suffered from the
violence of a Jacobin municipality, the reaction swung to
the opposite extreme. A movement, beginning in honest
disgust with the proceedings in Paris and with the conduct
of the dominant party in their own city, insensibly carried
its promoters further than they had intended; until a
point was reached from which, before the savage spirit of
the capital, it became dangerous to recede. Long identified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
with the royal navy, as one of the chief arsenals of
the kingdom, there could not but exist among a large class
a feeling of loyalty to the monarchy. Submissive to the
course of events so long as France had a show of government,
now, in the dissolution of civil order, it seemed
allowable to choose their own path.</p>

<p>With such dispositions, a decree of the Convention
declaring the city outlawed enabled the royalists to guide
the movement in the direction they desired. The leading
naval officers do not appear to have co-operated willingly
with the advances made to the British admiral;
but for years they had seen their authority undermined
by the course of the national legislature, and had become
accustomed to yield to the popular control of the
moment. The news of the approach of the Conventional
army, accompanied by the rush into the place of terror-stricken
fugitives from Marseille, precipitated Toulon
into the arms of Great Britain. The sections declared
that the city adopted the monarchical government as
organized by the Constituent Assembly of 1789; proclaimed
Louis XVII. king; ordered the disarmament of
the French fleet in the port, and placed in the hands
of the British admiral the works commanding the harbor.
Lord Hood undertook that the forts and ships
should be restored unharmed to France, when peace was
made. On the 27th, the British and Spanish fleets anchored
in the outer harbor of Toulon, and the city ran up
the white flag of the Bourbons. There were in the port
at the time of its delivery to the British admiral thirty
ships-of-the-line of seventy-four guns and upward, being
rather more than one third the line-of-battle force of the
French navy. Of these, seventeen were in the outer harbor
ready for sea. There were, besides, twenty-odd frigates
or smaller vessels.</p>

<p>While one of the principal naval arsenals of France, and
the only one she possessed on the Mediterranean, was thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
passing into the hands of the enemy, disasters were accumulating
on her eastern borders. On the 12th of July,
the fortified town of Condé, on the Belgian frontier, surrendered.
This was followed on the 28th by the capitulation
of the first-class fortress of Valenciennes in the same
locality, after six weeks of open trenches. These two
prizes fell to the allied Austrians, British and Dutch, and
their submission was followed by an advance of the combined
armies and retreat of the French. Shortly before,
on the 22d of July, Mayence, a position of the utmost
importance on the Rhine, had yielded to the Prussians;
and here also the enemy advanced into the Vosges mountains
and toward the upper Rhine, the French receding
gradually before them. The great inland city of Lyon was
at the same time holding out against the central government
with a firmness which as yet needed not the support
of despair. In its resistance, and in the scarce smothered
discontent of the southern provinces, lay the chief
significance and utility of the British hold on Toulon. As
a point upon which insurrection could repose, by which it
could be supported from without, Toulon was invaluable;
but with rebellion put down, surrounded by a hostile army
and shut up to itself, the city would become a useless burden,
unbearable from the demands for men which its extended
lines would make. Had La Vendée rested upon
a Toulon, the task of the republic would have been well-nigh
hopeless.</p>

<p>Among these multiplied disasters, with the Sardinians
also operating on the Alpine frontier and the Spaniards
entering their country by the eastern Pyrenees, France
was confronted in every quarter by disciplined armies to
which she could as yet oppose only raw and ragged levies.
She found her safety in the stern energy of a legislature
which silenced faction by terror, in her central position,
which of itself separated from one another many of the
centres of disturbance, and in the military policy of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
allies, which increased instead of seeking to diminish
the dissemination of force which was to some extent unavoidable.
The Spaniards could not combine with the
Sardinians, Toulon could not help Lyon, La Vendée had
to stand apart from all the others; but in the east it
was possible for the Austrians, Prussians and British to
direct against the forces standing between them and Paris
a combination of effort which, in the then condition of
the French army, might have been irresistible. Instead
of so doing, the Austrians and British on the northeastern
frontier decided, early in August, to cease their advance
and to separate; the Austrians sitting down before Le
Quesnoy, and the British undertaking to besiege the seaport
of Dunkirk. On the Rhine, the mutual jealousies
of Austria and Prussia, and the sluggish movements of
routine generals, caused a similar failure to support each
other, and a similar dilatory action.</p>

<p>The opportunities thus lost by the allies, and the time
conceded to the French, were improved to the full by
the Committee of Public Safety and by the commissioners
sent from the Convention to the headquarters of every
army. Men, for the most part, without pity as without
fear, their administration, stained as it was with blood,
was effectual to the salvation of France. From the minister
in the cabinet to the general in the field, and down
to the raw recruit forced from his home, each man felt
his life to depend upon his submission and his activity.
In the imminent danger of the country and the hot haste
of men who worked not only under urgent pressure, but
often with a zeal as blindly ignorant as it was patriotic,
many blunders and injustices were committed; but they
attained the desired end of impressing the resistless energy
of the Convention upon each unit of the masses it
was wielding. If ever, for good or ill, men had the single
eye, it was to be found in the French soldiers of 1793, as
they starved and bled and died that the country might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
live. Given time,—and the allies gave it,—units animated
by such a spirit, and driven forward by such an
impetus as the Committee knew how to impart, were soon
knit into an overpowering organism, as superior in temper
as they were in numbers to the trained machines before
them.</p>

<p>Where there was conscious life to feel enthusiasm or
fear, the contagion of the rulers' temper caught; but the
fiery spirit of the Convention could not possess the stately
ships of war that floated in the ports of the republic, nor
make them yield, to the yet unskilled hands of the new
officers, the docile obedience which their old masters had
commanded from those beautiful, delicately poised machines.
It was a vain hope to conjure victory at sea by
harsh decrees,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
pitched in unison to the passions of the
times, but addressed to men whose abilities did not respond
to their own courage nor to the calls thus made
upon them. To the inexperience of the officers was added
the further difficulty of the indiscipline of the crews, that
had increased to a ruinous extent during the four years'
paralysis of the executive government. With the triumph
of the Jacobin party had now come a unity which, however
terrible, was efficient. In September, 1793, in the mutiny
of the Brest fleet in Quiberon Bay, the seamen again prevailed
over their officers, and even over the commissioner
of the Convention; but it was the last flagrant outburst.
The past weakness of other authorities had played into
the hands of the Mountain; now that the latter was supreme,
it resolutely enjoined and soon obtained submission.
Years of insubordination and license had, however,
sapped the organization and drill of the crews; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
new officers were not the men to restore them. The Convention
and its commissioners therefore lacked the proper
instruments through which they could impart direction as
well as energy to the movement of the fleet. Ships were
there and guns, men also to handle the one and fight the
other; but between these and the government was needed
an adequate official staff, which no longer existed. The
same administrative weakness that had allowed discipline
to perish, had also entailed upon the naval arsenals the
penury of resources that was felt everywhere in the land.
From all these circumstances arose an impotence which
caused the year 1793 to be barren of serious naval effort
on the part of France.</p>

<p>Great Britain herself was in this first year of war unprepared
to take a vigorous initiative. In 1792 she had
in commission at home but twelve ships-of-the-line, and
but sixteen thousand seamen were allowed for the fleet.
Not till December 20, six weeks only before the declaration
of war, did Parliament increase these to twenty-five
thousand, a number less than one fourth that employed in
the last year of the American war. In the Mediterranean
and in the colonies there was not then present a single
ship-of-the-line, properly so called. Fortunately, of the one
hundred and thirteen actually borne on the roll of the
line-of-battle as cruising ships, at the beginning of 1793,
between eighty and ninety were reported in good condition,
owing to the two alarms of war in 1790 and 1791; and
provident administration had kept on hand in the British
dockyards the necessary equipments, which had disappeared
from those of France. More difficulty was experienced
in manning than in equipping; but at the end
of 1793, there were eighty-five of the line actually in commission.
From twenty to twenty-five were allotted to the
Channel fleet, cruising from thence to Cape Finisterre,
under the command of Lord Howe; a like number to the
Mediterranean under Lord Hood; and from ten to twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to the West Indies. A reserve of twenty-five ships remained
in the Channel ports, Portsmouth and Plymouth,
ready for sea, and employed, as occasion demanded, for
convoys, to fill vacancies of disabled ships in the cruising
fleets, or to strengthen the latter in case of special need.</p>

<p>The mobilization of the fleet, though energetic when
once begun, was nevertheless tardy, and Great Britain
had reason to be thankful that years of civil commotion
and executive impotence had so greatly deteriorated the
enemy's navy, and also, at a critical moment, had thrown
so large a portion of it into her hands at Toulon. With
a widely scattered empire, with numerous exposed and
isolated points, with a smaller population and an army
comparatively insignificant in numbers, war with France
threw her—and must inevitably always throw her—at
first upon the defensive, unless she could at once lay her
grasp firmly upon some vital chord of the enemy's communications,
and so force him to fight there. She could
not assume the offensive by landing on French soil. No
force she could send would be capable of resisting the
numbers brought against it, much less of injuring the
enemy; nor should the flattering hopes of such a force
serving as a nucleus, round which to crystallize French rebellion,
have been suffered to delude her, after the bitter
deceptions of the recent American struggle. What hopes
had not Great Britain then based upon old loyalty, and
upon discontent with the new order of things! Yet,
though such discontent undoubtedly existed—and that
among men of her own race recently her subjects—the
expeditions sent among them rallied no decisive following,
kindled no fire of resistance. The natives of the soil,
among whom such a force appears, either view it with
jealous suspicion or expect it to do all the work; not
unfrequently are both jealous and inactive. It is well,
then, to give malcontents all the assistance they evidently
require in material of war, to keep alive as a diversion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
every such focus of trouble, to secure wherever possible,
as at Toulon, a fortified port by which to maintain free
entrance for supplies to the country of the insurgents;
but it is not safe to reckon on the hatred of the latter
for their own countrymen outweighing their dislike for
the foreigner. It is not good policy to send a force that,
from its own numbers, is incapable of successful independent
action, relying upon the support of the natives in a
civil war. Such support can never relieve such expeditions
from the necessity, common to all military advances,
of guarding their communications while operating on their
front; which is only another way of saying again that
such expeditions, to be successful, must be capable of
independent action adequate to the end proposed. Risings,
such as occurred in many quarters of France in
1793, are useful diversions; but a diversion is only a
subordinate part in the drama of war. It is either a deceit,
whose success depends rather upon the incapacity
of the opponent than upon its own merits; or it is an
indirect use of forces which, from their character or position,
cannot be made to conduce directly to the main
effort of the enterprise in hand. To enlarge such diversions
by bodies of troops which might be strengthening
the armies on the central theatre of war is a mistake,
which increases in ever greater proportion as the forces
so diverted grow more numerous.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Offensive action of this character was therefore forbidden
to Great Britain. To use small bodies for it was
impolitic; and large bodies she had not to send. To
strike a direct blow at France, it was necessary to force
her to come out of her ports and fight, and this was to
be accomplished only by threatening some external interests
of vital importance to her. Such interests of her
own, however, France had not. Her merchant shipping,
in peace, carried less than one third of her trade, and
was at once hurried into her ports when war began. Her
West India colonies had indeed been valuable, that of
Haïti very much so; but the anarchy of the past four
years had annihilated its prosperity. There remained
only to strike at her communications, through neutrals,
with the outside world, and this was to be accomplished
by the same means as most surely conduced to the defence
of all parts of the British empire,—by taking up positions
off the French coast, and drawing the lines as closely as
the exigencies of the sea and the law of nations would
permit. If possible, in order to stop commerce by neutral
vessels, a blockade of the French coast, similar to that
of the Southern Confederacy by the United States, would
have been the most suitable measure to adopt; but the
conditions were very different. The weather on the coast
of the Southern States is much more moderate; the heaviest
gales blow along shore, whereas, in the Bay of Biscay,
they blow dead on shore; and there was almost everywhere
good, sometimes even sheltered, anchorage, which
was not generally to be had on the coast of France. Finally,
while steam certainly helps both parties, the inside
and the out, the latter profits the more by it, for he can
keep in with the shore to a degree, and for a length of
time, impossible to the sailing ship; the necessity of gaining
an offing <i>before</i> a gale comes on, and the helpless drifting
during its continuance, not existing for the steamer.</p>

<p>Despite, therefore, the decisions of the courts, that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
blockade was not technically removed when the ships
maintaining it were driven off by weather; a blockade of
the whole French coast does not seem to have been contemplated
by the British ministry. Its offensive measures
against French commerce were consequently limited to the
capture of property belonging to French subjects, wherever
found afloat, even under neutral flags; and to the
seizure of all contraband goods destined to France, to
whomsoever they belonged. Both these were conceded
to be within the rights of a belligerent by the United
States and Great Britain; but the latter now endeavored
to stretch the definition of contraband to a degree that
would enable her to increase the pressure upon France.
She claimed that naval stores were included in the category,—a
position the more plausible at that time because,
the French merchant ships being unable to go to sea, the
stores must be for the navy,—and further, that provisions
were so. Though these arguments were hotly contested
by neutrals, the British navy was strong enough to override
all remonstrances; and the dearth of provisions did
force the Brest fleet out in 1794, and so led directly to
the first great naval battle of the war.</p>

<p>It cannot be considered a satisfactory result, nor one
evincing adequate preparation, that the Channel fleet, to
which belonged the protection of the approaches to the
Channel,—the great focus of British trade,—to which
also was assigned the duty of watching Brest, the chief
French arsenál on the Atlantic, did not get to sea till
July 14, and then only to the number of fifteen ships-of-the-line.
A French fleet of similar size had sailed from
Brest six weeks before, on the 4th of June, and taken a
position in Quiberon Bay, off the coast of La Vendée, to
intercept assistance to the insurgents of that province.
The command of the Channel fleet was given to Lord
Howe, an officer of very high character for activity and
enterprise in previous wars, but now in his sixty-eighth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
year. Age had in no sense dulled his courage, which
was as steadfast and well-nigh as impassive as a rock,
nor impaired his mental efficiency; but it may be permitted
to think that time had exaggerated and hardened
a certain formal, unbending precision of action which distinguished
him, and that rigid uniformity of manœuvre
had become exalted in his eyes from a means to an end.
This quality, however, joined to an intimate knowledge
of naval tactics, eminently fitted him for the hard and
thankless task of forming into a well-drilled whole the
scattered units of the fleet, which came to him unaccustomed,
for the most part, to combined action.</p>

<p>Lord Howe brought also to his command a strong predisposition,
closely allied with the methodical tendency
just noted, to economize his fleet, by keeping it sparingly
at sea and then chiefly for purposes of drill and manœuvre.
Its preservation in good condition was in his eyes a consideration
superior to taking up the best strategic position;
and he steadily resisted the policy of continuous cruising
before the ports whence the enemy must sail, alleging that
the injury received in heavy winter weather, while the
French lay at anchor inside, would keep the British force
constantly inferior. The argument, though plausible and
based on undoubted facts, does not justify the choice of
a position clearly disadvantageous with reference to intercepting
the enemy. War presents constantly a choice
of difficulties, and when questions of material come in conflict
with correct strategic disposition they must give way.
The place for the British fleet, as reflection shows and
experience proved, was before the hostile arsenals; or,
allowably, if such a position could be found, in a port
flanking the route along which the enemy must pass.
For the Channel fleet no such port offered; and in keeping
it at Spithead, far in rear of the French point of departure,
Howe exposed himself to the embarrassment of
their getting away while he remained in ignorance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
fact until too late to intercept, and with imperfect knowledge
in what direction to follow. The only solution of
the difficulty that the British government should have
adopted was to maintain a reserve of ships, large enough
to keep the necessary numbers of efficient vessels cruising
in the proper station. The experience gained by such
constant practice, moreover, improved the quality of the
men more than it injured the ships. Historically, good
men with poor ships are better than poor men with good
ships; over and over again the French Revolution taught
this lesson, which our own age, with its rage for the last
new thing in material improvement, has largely dropped
out of memory.</p>

<p>The embarrassment arising from the British fleet being
in a Channel port received singular, perhaps even exceptional,
illustration in the French expedition against Ireland
in 1796. It has been said that that expedition would
have succeeded in landing its force had it had steam;
it would be more just to say that it would never have
come so near succeeding had the British fleet been cruising
in the station which strategic considerations would
prescribe.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
There is also a certain indefinable, but real,
deterioration in the <i>morale</i> of a fleet habitually in port,
compared with one habitually at sea; the habit of being
on the alert and the habit of being at rest color the whole
conduct of a military force. This was keenly realized by
that great commander, Lord St. Vincent, and concurred
with his correct strategic insight to fix his policy of close-watching
the enemy's ports. "I will not lie here," he
wrote from Lisbon in December, 1796, "a moment
longer than is necessary to put us to rights; for you well
know that inaction in the Tagus must make us all cowards."
<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Doubtless this practice of lying at anchor in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
home ports contributed to the impunity with which French
cruisers swept the approaches to the Channel during much
of 1793 and 1794.</p>

<p>The policy of Lord Howe combined with the crippled
state of the French navy to render the year 1793 barren
of striking maritime events in the Atlantic. In the interior
of France and on her frontiers, amid many disasters
and bloody tyranny, the saving energy of the fierce
revolutionary government was making steady headway
against the unparalleled difficulties surrounding it. After
the ill-judged separation of the British and Austrians in
August, the latter had succeeded in reducing Le Quesnoy,
which capitulated on the 11th of September; but there
their successes ended. Carnot, recently made a member
of the Committee of Public Safety and specially charged
with the direction of the war, concerted an overwhelming
attack upon the British before Dunkirk, and raised the
siege on the 9th of September; then, by a similar concentration
upon the Austrians, now engaged in besieging
Maubeuge, he caused their defeat at the battle of Wattignies,
October 16, and forced them to retreat from before
the place. In the north-east, both the allies and the
French went into winter quarters early in November;
but the prestige of a resistance that grew every day more
efficient remained with the latter. On the eastern frontier
also, after protracted fighting, the year closed with substantial
success for them. The Prussians of the allied
forces in that quarter retreated from all their advanced
positions into Mayence; the Austrians retired to the east
bank of the Rhine. Each of the allies blamed the other
for the unfortunate issue of the campaign; and the veteran
Duke of Brunswick, commanding the Prussians, sent
in his resignation accompanied with predictions of continued
disaster. At the same time the king of Prussia
began to manifest the vacillating and shameless policy
which made his country the byword of Europe during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the next twelve years, and betrayed clearly his purpose
of forsaking the coalition he had been so forward in forming.
On the Spanish frontiers, the fortune of war was
rather against the French, who were embarrassed by the
necessity of concentrating all the force possible upon the
siege of Toulon; the recovery of that port being urgently
required for the national honor, as well as for the maritime
interests of the republic in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>It was, however, in restoring internal submission and
asserting the authority of the central government that
the most substantial results of 1793 were attained. The
resistance of the Vendeans, long successfully protracted
through the blunders and lack of unity among the republican
leaders, began to yield, as more concentrated
effort was imparted by the reconstituted Committee of
Public Safety. After the battle of Cholet, October 16,
the insurgents, routed and in despair, determined to leave
their own country, cross the Loire, and march into Brittany.
They traversed the latter province slowly, fighting
as they went, and on the 12th of November reached Granville
on the Channel coast, where they hoped to open
communications with England. Their assault on the town
failed, and as the hoped-for ships did not arrive, they
started back for La Vendée; but as a coherent body they
never recrossed the Loire, and a pitched battle, fought
December 22, at Savenay, on the north bank, completed
their dispersion. The embers of the civil war continued
to burn in La Vendée and north of the Loire during the
following year; but as a general insurrection, wielding
large bodies of fighting men, it had ceased to be formidable
to the nation and wrought its chief harm to the
province which supported it.</p>

<p>The great stronghold of resistance in the east, Lyon,
fell on the 9th of October. Despite the disaffection which
had existed in the south and east, the commissioners of
the government were able, without opposition, to collect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
round the city a body of men sufficient, first, to cut off
its communications with the surrounding country, and,
finally, to carry the works commanding the place. A
spirit of discontent so feeble as to acquiesce tamely in
the reduction of one of its chief centres gave no hope
of support to any efforts made through Toulon by the
allied forces; and the capitulation of Lyon showed that
the port was not worth the cost of keeping, and at the
same time released a large number of men to give activity
to the siege. Toward the end of November, over twenty-five
thousand republican troops were collected round the
place. On the night of the 16th of December, the forts
on a promontory commanding the anchorage for fleets
were carried by assault. A council of war among the allies
decided that the ships could not remain, and that the
garrison could not hold out with its communications to
the sea cut off. It therefore determined to evacuate the
place, and on the 19th the British and Spaniards departed.
Before sailing, an attempt was made to destroy both the
dockyard and all the French ships that could not be taken
away; but the danger threatening from the commanding
positions that had now fallen to the enemy was so great,
the necessity for quick departure so urgent, and so much
had consequently to be done in a very limited time, that
the proposed destruction was but imperfectly effected.
Of twenty-seven French ships-of-the-line still in Toulon,
nine were burned and three accompanied the retreat. The
remaining fifteen constituted the nucleus of a powerful
force, and most of them appear in the fleet which went
with Bonaparte to Egypt and was there destroyed by
Nelson in 1798.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The loss of Toulon, after the extravagant hopes excited
by its surrender, gave rise to much complaint in England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
It is improbable, however, that its retention, even if feasible,
would have been beneficial. The expenditure of men
and money necessary to hold a seaport surrounded by
enemy's territory, and commanded by a long line of
heights which had to be occupied, would have been out
of proportion to any result likely to follow. The communications,
being by sea only, would ultimately depend
upon Great Britain as the power best able to insure them
and most interested in a naval position; and the distance
to England was great. The utter lack of dependence to
be placed upon local discontent, as an element in the
usefulness of Toulon to the allied cause, had been shown
by the failure to support Lyon and by the tame submission
made in the southern provinces to the petty Conventional
army sent against them. The country, moreover,
was in 1793 wasted by dearth; and had there been in
Toulon an allied force large enough to advance, it would
have had to depend absolutely upon immense accumulations
of food in the port. So great was the scarcity, that
the French at one time thought of abandoning the siege
on that account. In short, Toulon had, for the British,
the disadvantage of great distance, far greater than Gibraltar,
without the latter's advantages of strategic position
and easy defence; and its occupation by them would have
caused jealousy among the Mediterranean powers and
introduced more discord into a coalition already mutually
suspicious.</p>

<p>From Toulon Hood retired to Hyères Bay, a sheltered
roadstead a few miles east of Toulon, where the end of
the year found him still lying. Lord Howe took the
Channel fleet into port in the middle of December, and
there remained until the following May. Thus ended the
maritime year 1793.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="sc"><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE">Note</a></span>
(<a href="#Page_98">to page 98)</a>. The Peninsular War, in its inception, was
justified, not because the odds were favorable, but because there was
a "fighting" chance of great results; just as there was at Toulon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
where the attempt failed. The distinguished historian of that war
claims that the British wrought the work of deliverance; and, after
making every allowance for national prejudice, which in his case
was certainly not undiscriminating, the general failure, except where
the British arms were felt, may be taken to establish a fact which
the disorganized state of Spain herself would alone render probable.
The course of war in the west of the peninsula, where the
British were, shows conclusively the limitations imposed upon the
military enterprises of a state having a relatively small army with
a great navy. Having landed in April, 1809, Wellesley, notwithstanding
his genius and brilliant successes, notwithstanding the state
of the peninsula, and notwithstanding, also, the immense length
and difficulty of the French lines of communication, was still, in
March, 1811, shut up within the lines of Torres Vedras; that is, he
was simply holding on at Lisbon, unable to keep the country against
the French. In external appearance, the military situation was just
the same as at the beginning. The reasons for holding on were the
same in character as in 1809; but the chances of success had become
distinctly greater, owing to political and economical considerations,
and to the extreme care and foresight by which the British leader
had made his position round Lisbon inexpugnable. Nevertheless,
the retreat and ultimate disaster of the French were due to the
military difficulties of their enterprise, well understood and carefully
improved by Wellington, and to the unmeasured political combinations
of the emperor,—not to the power of the British army in
Portugal, which, though admirable in quality and leadership, was
very inferior in numbers. In the last analysis it was the emperor's
Continental System, directed against the Sea Power of England,
which gave to the army of England in the Peninsula the opportunity
by which alone the weaker force can profitably assume the offensive.
It is not a lessening, but a heightening, of the merit of the
great Englishman, to say that he had the genius to foresee that the
opportunity, though distant, must come, and the courage to hold on
till it came.</p>

<p>It is instructive to note the essential military resemblances between
the British invasion of the Peninsula, which was finally
crowned with success, and Napoleon's projected invasion of England,
which came to nought. In the one case, a navy supreme on
the ocean and a small military force; in the other, an unrivalled
army, and a navy very inferior because of its quality. In each, the
chances were largely against success. In each, the enterprise, strictly
offensive in character by the inferior force, hinged upon the occurrence
of the favorable opportunity, which it was the part of the offence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to contrive and of the defence to prevent. That there was,
in both cases, a long waiting of nearly equal duration is a fortuitous
coincidence; but the attitude of unremitting watchfulness and
constant readiness, in a skilfully chosen position, is the distinctive
characteristic imposed upon the inferior force which hopes to escape
from a mere defensive posture, and, by striking a blow, to
make itself felt in the lists of war. The opportunity never came
to Napoleon, because the British leaders never took their eyes off
his fleet, upon which his profound combinations depended as an
arch upon its keystone. It came to Wellington because the emperor
turned his attention from the Peninsula, of whose troubles he was
weary, and opposed inadequate means and divided commands to a
single alert enemy.</p></div>

</div>

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">The West Indies, 1793-1810.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap">AMONG the leading objects contemplated by the British
ministry in this war was the control of the
East and West Indies, particularly of the latter, as among
the most important sources as well as markets of British
trade. In the present day, the value of the West India
islands, and of all positions in the Caribbean Sea, is
chiefly military or maritime; due less to the commerce
they maintain than to their relations, as coaling ports
or fortified stations, to the commercial routes passing
through that region. It is scarcely necessary to add that
whatever importance of this character they now possess
will be vastly increased when an interoceanic canal is
completed. During the French revolution, however, the
islands had a great commercial value, and about one
fourth the total amount of British commerce, both export
and import, was done with them. This lucrative trade
Great Britain had gathered into her hands, notwithstanding
the fact that other nations owned the largest and
richest of the islands, as well as those producing the best
sugar and coffee. The commercial aptitudes of the British
people, the superior quality of their manufactures, their extensive
merchant shipping and ingenious trade regulations,
conspired to make it the interest of the foreign colonists
to trade with them, even when by so doing the laws of
their own governments were defied; and to a great extent
the British free ports engrossed the West Indian
trade, as well as that to the adjacent South and Central
American coasts, known as the Spanish Main.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>In war, the control of a maritime region depends upon
naval preponderance. When the opposing navies are of
nearly equal strength, it is only by open battle, and by
the reduction of one to a state of complete inferiority,
that control can be asserted. If the region contested be
small and compact, as, for instance, the immediate approaches
to the English Channel, the preponderance of
the fleet alone will determine the control and the safety
of the national commerce within its limits; but if it be
extensive, the distance between centres great, and the
centres themselves weak, the same difficulties arise that
are felt in maintaining order in a large and sparsely
settled territory on land, as has till very lately been the
case in our western Territories. In such circumstances
the security of the traveller depends upon the government
putting down nests of lawlessness, and establishing, at
fitting stations, organized forces, that can by their activity
insure reasonable safety in all directions.</p>

<p>In the War of the French Revolution, it soon, though
not immediately, became evident, that the British navy
could everywhere preponderate in force over its enemy;
but it could not be omnipresent. The Caribbean Sea
offered conditions peculiarly favorable to marauders, licensed
or unlicensed; while its commercial value necessitated
the preservation, and, as far as possible, the monopoly,
of so fruitful a source of revenue. The presence
of hostile cruisers not only inflicted direct loss, which
was measured by their actual captures, but, beyond these,
caused a great indirect injury by the friction and delays
which the sense of insecurity always introduces into commercial
transactions. The ideal aim of the British ministry
was to banish the enemy's cruisers absolutely from
the region; but, if this was impossible, very much might
be effected by depriving them of every friendly anchorage
to which they could repair to refit or take their prizes,—in
short, by capturing all the French islands. This would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
put an end to the myriads of very small craft, which,
being able to keep the sea but for a few days, depended
absolutely upon a near base; and would greatly cripple
the operations of the larger vessels by throwing them,
for supplies and refuge, upon the United States, which
then extended a benevolent partiality to French cruisers
and their prizes.</p>

<p>The French islands had vividly reflected during the
past four years the movements and passions of the mother-country;
but only in Haïti did the turbulence, extending
through all classes of society until it ended in a servile
insurrection, result in destroying the control of the home
government. The disorder, amounting often to anarchy,
which prevailed through the French part of the island,
somewhat simplified the problem before Great Britain.
It was the only base of operations to the westward then
available for French cruisers; and, though too large to
admit the thought of conquest under the climatic conditions
with the force that could be spared for such an
attempt, it was possible, without serious opposition, to
occupy many of the ports commanding the principal trade
routes. Such occupation deprived the enemy of their use,
converted them into harbors of refuge for British commerce,
and made them centres for the operations of British
cruisers. Unfortunately the government, misled by
the representations of French planters who saw their
property threatened with destruction, conceived the hope
of an easy conquest, or rather transfer of allegiance in
the colony. In pursuance of this idea, several places were
taken into possession, being either delivered or captured
with an ease that showed how readily, in the then disorganized
state of the island, most of the seaports could
have been secured; but the motive being conquest, and
not merely maritime control, the choice of objectives was
decided by political or military, instead of maritime, considerations.
The expected local native support followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the general rule noted in the last chapter, and proved
futile; while yellow fever wasted the troops condemned
to excessive exertion and exposure in so sickly a clime.</p>

<p>Had simple maritime advantages guided the British
counsels, it would have been sufficient to note that Jamaica
was the great centre of British interests in the
western Caribbean; that outward-bound ships, entering
the Caribbean through the eastern, or Windward, Islands,
ran down with the trade wind along the south side of
Haiti, where were two harbors, Aux Cayes and Jacmel,
favorable as bases for privateers; and that the homeward
trade passed through the Windward Passage, between
Haïti and Cuba, which was flanked by two Haïtian ports,
Tiburon to the south and Mole St. Nicolas on the
north. These four were, therefore, particularly dangerous
to British trade, and consequently, so far as position
went, particularly advantageous if in British occupation.
It is true that the topographical conditions of the ground
about a seaport in an enemy's country may make the
occupation very hazardous, except by the employment of
more men than can be had; as was the case at Mole
St. Nicolas, where the fortifications of the place itself
were commanded by the surrounding heights. Yet it remained
in the hands of the British from 1793 to 1798;
and it may be believed that their interests would have
been well served by strongly garrisoning these ports.
<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
At the least they would so be lost to French cruisers.
Instead of this, with the idea of conquest, the wholly
insufficient forces sent were pushed down to the bottom
of the bight of Gonaives, and the southern coast of
the island was left in the enemy's hands. It is not desirable
to give in detail the history of these petty military
operations, nor of the civil commotions with which
they were connected. Suffice it to say, that the course
of events finally threw the government into the hands
of a pure negro, Toussaint L'Ouverture. He continued
to hold it till the Peace of Amiens, in 1802; and with
him the British, in 1798, concluded a treaty by which
they finally abandoned the island. Though the scheme
of conquest had failed, their interference had opened the
country to British trade and caused the loss of Haïti to
France, by contributing to the rise of Toussaint, the negro
most capable of leading his race. He still professed fidelity
to the mother-country, but he acted as one possessing
independent power. The British, by the treaty, recognized
the island as a neutral territory, and Toussaint, on his
part, permitted them as well as neutral ships to trade
with it.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
He also prohibited the sailing of privateers from
ports of Haïti, as they seriously interfered with its commerce.
<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Under his strong and wise administration the
prosperity of the island greatly revived, though without
attaining the proportions of former days.</p>

<p>The islands known as the Lesser Antilles, which extend
from Porto Rico in a southerly direction to Trinidad
and form the eastern boundary of the Caribbean, are, from
their small size, much more dependent than is Haïti or
Cuba upon the control of the sea. Though the aggregate
commercial value of the whole group was far inferior to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
that of the French part alone of Haïti, they had a distinct
military advantage which made them, in that point of
view and to the West Indies, more important than Haïti
itself. They were to windward of the whole Caribbean
with reference to the trade winds, which blow unceasingly
from east to west; and hence were much nearer in time,
that supreme factor in military combinations, to the great
western islands than the latter were to them. The same
circumstance of the trade wind threw them across the
path of vessels bound from Europe to all parts of the
Caribbean, and thus facilitated the intercepting of supplies
essential to the support and industries of the islands,
for much of which they depended upon the mother-countries.</p>

<p>The largest, by far, of these islands, Trinidad, belonged
in 1793 to Spain, at that time the ally of Great Britain.
Its nearness to the South American continent gave it, as
a distributing centre, marked commercial advantages, of
which the unenterprising Spaniards made little use; but,
as the trade winds blow from the north of east, it was not
favorably placed for a naval station. The two next in size,
and among the most fertile, Guadaloupe and Martinique,
were French islands. Being in the centre of the chain
and to leeward of none, except the outlying English Barbadoes,
they were admirably situated for military control,
and the strategic advantage of position was supplemented
by the defensive strength of Fort Royal (now Fort de
France), the principal harbor of Martinique; which was
then, as it is now, by far the most powerful naval position
in the eastern Caribbean. Besides them, France owned
Santa Lucia, next south of Martinique, and Tobago. The
military importance of these islands, combined with a
distinct though minor commercial value, and the experience
in past wars of the injury done to British commerce
by privateering based upon them, made their reduction
advisable to Great Britain; to whom belonged most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the other Lesser Antilles as well as the trade of the Caribbean.
One of the first acts of the war, before sending
a vessel to the Mediterranean or increasing the Channel
fleet, was to despatch a squadron of seven sail-of-the-line
to the West Indies, where there were at that time, except
a few small cruisers, but two fifty-gun ships, one at Jamaica
and one to windward,—a thousand miles apart.
No fact shows more strongly how unprepared Great Britain
was for war than the naval destitution of this region,
at a time when France had three or four ships-of-the-line
continually in her colonies. This British squadron sailed
under the command of Admiral Gardner on the 24th of
March, 1793; and there was a strong expectation that
Martinique and Guadaloupe, which had hoisted the old
royal standard of France upon learning the deposition of
Louis XVI., would place themselves under British protection.
This hope was disappointed, they having already
resumed their republican allegiance, and Gardner returned
to England in the fall, leaving a part of his squadron
behind.</p>

<p>It was then decided to reduce the French islands by
force, and on the 26th of November Sir John Jervis, afterwards
Earl St. Vincent, sailed with a small force of ships-of-war
carrying seven thousand troops destined for this
service. Reaching Barbadoes in January, the expedition
appeared off Martinique on the 5th of February, 1794, and
after a series of successful operations the island capitulated
on the 22d of March. A detachment was next sent against
Santa Lucia, which was surrendered on the 4th of April.
On the 10th of the same month the combined naval and
military forces anchored off Guadaloupe, and on the 20th
this island, with its off-lying dependencies, Marie-Galante,
Desirade and the Saints, also submitted. Tobago having
been seized with slight resistance in April, 1793, Great
Britain was now in possession of all the hostile Windward
Islands, except the petty St. Martin, part of which belonged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to France. A considerable detachment of troops was next
sent to Mole St. Nicolas to assist the undertaking against
Haïti; a reduction of the force in the Windward Islands
which led to disastrous consequences, felt throughout the
war by the islands and commerce of Great Britain. For
on the 3d of June, when the British commanders had
departed leaving a garrison in Guadaloupe, there appeared
off the coast a division of ships, two being frigates and the
others transports, which had left France in April, before
the loss of the colonies was known. Landing without
opposition, they established themselves firmly and gained
possession of half the island before Jervis and Grey could
appear. The struggle continued with varying fortunes
during the following six months, but the British continually
lost ground and wasted with yellow fever. This dire
disease told likewise severely on the new French arrivals,
but these found a native Creole population of nearly six
thousand, the larger part of whom were faithful to the
republic; whereas their enemies, out of a total original
force of seven thousand, had, besides losses in battle and by
disease, been obliged to spare garrisons for the captured
islands and a detachment to Haïti. These causes alone
would seem sufficient to account for the recapture of the
island; but the utmost credit must at the same time be
allowed to the French officers concerned, and especially to
the commissioner of the Convention, Victor Hugues, who
accompanied the expedition. This man, who had at Rochefort
filled the rôle of public accuser, which in Paris gained
for Fouquier Tinville a hideous immortality, seems to have
embodied in himself the best and worst features of the men
of the Terror, whose fate he escaped by leaving France
betimes. In his report to the Convention he boasted of
having put to death twelve hundred royalists in Guadaloupe.
This horror partakes doubtless of the evident exaggerations
discernible in the French accounts of a military
operation which, not so adorned, would have been brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
enough. Hugues's brutality is unquestionable, but to it he
joined the vigor, audacity, and unscrupulous determination
to succeed which carried the French armies to victory in
all parts. The British were forced to evacuate their last
port in Guadaloupe on the 10th of December, 1794.</p>

<p>Upon receiving news of Hugues's success the Directory
hastened to send re-enforcements, and on the 6th of January,
1795, a number of ships-of-war and transports reached
Guadaloupe and landed troops variously stated at fifteen
to twenty-five hundred. Hugues, who had meantime organized
a respectable territorial army, used the land and
naval forces now at his disposal with great energy. Santa
Lucia was retaken on the 19th of June, and insurrection
fomented and maintained in Dominica, St. Vincent and
Grenada, among the negroes, aborigines and old French
inhabitants, to the great distress of the British. National
vessels and privateers, having once more a secure base of
operations, swarmed throughout the seas and inflicted
great losses on the trade. All this disaster, which continued
throughout the year, arose from not having quite
enough men in Guadaloupe to put Hugues down before he
had a foothold; and the British government was now compelled
to send a far larger force to repair in part an evil,
which a smaller number, at the proper moment, would have
wholly prevented.</p>

<p>The disastrous result of the campaign of 1794 in Belgium
and Holland, resulting in the conquest of the latter by the
French, the overthrow of the House of Orange, and the
alliance of Holland with France under a republican government,
had both released the British troops employed on
the Continent and thrown open the Dutch colonies to British
attacks. Sir Ralph Abercromby, who had distinguished
himself in the recent operations, was appointed to the command
in the eastern Caribbean, and sixteen thousand troops
were assigned to the expedition, which was to be convoyed
by eight ships-of-the-line under Admiral Christian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
They were to have sailed in September for a campaign in
the drier and cooler winter months; but the usual difficulty
in moving large bodies, particularly of sailing ships,
delayed their departure until the 15th of November. Two
days later the Channel was swept by a gale of hurricane
violence, which caused the loss of many ships and lives,
and forced all that survived to return to Portsmouth, a
single transport alone reaching the destination at Barbadoes.
On the 3d of December a second start was made,
but almost equal bad fortune was met. After battling the
ocean for seven weeks, Christian and Abercromby returned to
England with part of the convoy, the remainder finding their
way by driblets to Barbadoes; several, however, were taken
by Hugues's cruisers. Abercromby then took passage in a
frigate, reaching the island on the 17th of March, 1796;
and was followed by the admiral, who arrived on the 21st
of April with a fleet of transports. Santa Lucia was at
once attacked, and on the 25th of May the French garrison
capitulated. On the 11th of June, St. Vincent, and a few
days later Grenada, which were in possession rather of
insurgents than of enemies, likewise submitted. Prior to
the arrival of Admiral Christian, Abercromby had sent a
detachment of twelve hundred men against the Dutch
colonies on the mainland, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice,
which surrendered without resistance in April and
May, and were laid open to British trade.</p>

<p>Great Britain had now resumed tranquil possession of all
the eastern islands, except Guadaloupe. The strong organization
which this had received from Hugues, and the
re-enforcements that had been thrown in, indicated that
prolonged operations would be needed to effect its subdual.
The sickly rainy season was at hand, during which
also hurricanes prevail, so that all reasons combined to
postpone the attempt to the healthier months,—a decision
which was amply justified by the great mortality from
yellow fever which ensued among the troops, despite all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the immunity from exposure that care and the cessation of
campaigning could give. By the time that operations could
begin, Spain had declared war against Great Britain; and
the prospect of easily seizing her large and far more valuable
islands diverted attention from Guadaloupe. The latter
continued throughout this and the following war, until
1810, a thorn in the side of British trade. The recapture
of Guadaloupe by the French, and the consequent evils,
remain a pregnant warning against the folly of sending a
boy to do a man's work; but underlying that miscalculation
appears to have been the fatal error of relying upon
local support to troops inadequate by themselves to the
task before them. Desirous of doing many things at once,
the British government easily accepted the assurances of
a few royalists, as to the political dispositions of a most
excitable and changeable race and the re-enforcements that
could be raised among them. It was an exact repetition
of the blunder which led to the invasion of the Southern
colonies during the American Revolution; and the gist of
the mistake is in the dependence upon unorganized forces
to supplement the weakness of the organized force, which
is not by itself alone sufficient to its undertaking.</p>

<p>It will not be denied that at times a diversion under
such conditions may be attempted, if it does not take away
force needed for serious enterprises. Upon this ground
may perhaps be justified the attempted French invasion of
Ireland in December, 1796, which, though on a somewhat
larger scale, essentially resembled the expedition of Jervis
and Grey against the West Indies. It also depended upon
a local rising in favor of an insufficient force, upon the
support of practically unorganized masses without military
antecedents; but it was undertaken at a period when the
tide of affairs elsewhere was running strongly in favor of
France, and, whatever hopes may have been entertained of
possible ultimate results, was essentially a diversion. The
immediate aim was not a direct gain to France, but an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
indirect advantage, by accumulating embarrassments for
Great Britain. A state entirely inferior at sea could not
count upon lasting military control of a large island with
an alien population; but it could hope that the insurrection
of Ireland, concurring with disaster upon the Continent,
might force a disadvantageous peace upon the arch enemy.
The conquest of the smaller Antilles, on the contrary, was
not properly a diversion, but an object of real importance
to a great British interest. It was feasible for the greater
naval power to take and hold them, being small; and their
tenure, by relieving the navy of part of its work, would
have facilitated the protection of Jamaica and its trade, as
well as the general control of the western Caribbean.
Haïti was too large and too populated for conquest; but
its power for injury could have been confronted with more
substantial force had Guadaloupe remained a British
garrison.</p>

<p>The alliance of Spain and Holland with France much
increased the difficulties of Great Britain, by throwing
open their colonial ports to French privateers. The extensive
sea-coasts of Cuba and Haïti became alive with them.
In 1807 it was estimated that there were from two to three
hundred depending upon these two islands, and unfitted,
from their size, to go far from them.
<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The number testifies
to the extent and value of British trade in that sea,
although the privateer did not confine his depredations to
the enemy, but preyed lawlessly on neutrals as well. The
same authority illustrates the annihilation of French and
Spanish commerce by stating that not more than two or
three British privateers were sailing from Jamaica.</p>

<p>General Abercromby went for a short time to Europe in
the fall of 1796. Upon his return a strong military and
naval expedition was sent against Trinidad, but did not
meet the resistance expected from the size and importance
of the island. It capitulated on the second day, February
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
18, 1797, and with it the Spaniards lost four ships-of-the-line.
Thence Abercromby moved, in April, against Porto
Rico; but upon reconnoitring, the defences were found
too strong, and the troops were re-embarked after losing
two hundred men. This ended the colonial expeditions in
the West Indies for the first war. Quiet possession was
taken of the Dutch colonies of Surinam and Curaçoa in
1799 and 1800; and in 1801, when Sweden and Denmark
became involved in hostilities with Great Britain, their
West India islands were also given up without resistance,
but no further fighting took place.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="sc">Note.</span> As it does not enter into the
author's plan to give in detail
the naval history after Trafalgar, it may be well to state here, in
brief, the subsequent events in the West Indies. At the Peace of
Amiens in 1801, Great Britain restored all her West India conquests
except the Spanish Trinidad. When war broke out again in 1803,
Tobago, Santa Lucia, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice were at once
seized without difficulty, as was Surinam in 1804. There matters
rested till 1807, when Curaçoa and the Danish islands fell, followed in
1809 by Martinique, and in 1810 by Guadaloupe. Spain having become
again the ally of Great Britain in 1808, the latter had now no
open enemy in the Caribbean; but the long habits of lawlessness left
numerous pirates infesting Cuba, whom the weak Spanish government
failed to control.</p></div>

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Naval Campaign of May, 1794, and Battle of the
First of June.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap">THE pressure of the allied armies upon all her frontiers,
combined with the British mastery of the sea,
had thrown France largely upon her own resources during
the year 1793; while the distracted condition of the country
and a bad harvest had united to cause a scarcity of
bread-stuffs, which threatened a famine, with all its consequences
of sufferings to the army and the people, and
inevitable increase of disturbance and sedition.</p>

<p>The eyes of the government had therefore turned beyond
the sea to the United States, and its representatives
there had been directed to accumulate a quantity of provisions
to be shipped to France. It was intended to despatch
these in a great convoy, to be protected on the
voyage by a force of ships-of-war; while its approach
to the shores of Europe would be covered by a sortie of
the great fleet from Brest and Rochefort, to occupy the
attention of, and, if necessary, forcibly to contest the control
of the sea with, the British navy. Experience had
not yet corrected the sanguine confidence of the republican
government, based upon the wordy enthusiasm of the
crews, nor taught it that, with the departure of the trained
officers and the spread of license among the men, the navy
had ceased to be the strong power which had faced Great
Britain with success in the war of the American Revolution.
The very measures which had most contributed to
destroy its efficiency became, in the excitement and ignorance
of the times, the sure gage of victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The convoying squadron of two ships-of-the-line and
three smaller vessels sailed from Brest for the United
States in December, 1793, under the command of Rear-Admiral
Van Stabel, an active and judicious officer. On
the 12th of February it anchored in Chesapeake Bay, and
sailed again for France on the 11th of April. The merchant
ships under its charge numbered one hundred and
thirty,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
among them being many laden with produce from
the French West India islands, which, not venturing to
make the passage home direct and unattended, for fear
of British cruisers, had collected at Hampton Roads to
await the time of sailing. It seems somewhat remarkable
that the British government, which was fairly well informed
as to the designs of the French, should not have
attempted to intercept the convoy at its port of departure.
That is the point at which a great maritime expedition,
whether purely military or otherwise, can usually be most
effectually watched; and in this case the more so, because,
if the convoy had eluded the blockading squadron,
the latter, few in number and homogeneous, could easily
have outstripped the unwieldy multitude and again awaited
it off its port of arrival. The success of this mass of merchantmen
in escaping the numerous enemies that attended
it off the coast of France is a striking illustration of the
uncertainties of commerce-destroying, and of the chances
that favor the safe arrival of a body of ships when the
enemy is in doubt as to their exact destination.</p>

<p>The French minister to the United States, M. Genêt,
had written home that he would forward a part of the
convoy, under the care of two small ships of war, as soon
as possible. With the idea that these might have sailed
before Van Stabel reached America, a force of five ships-of-the-line
with some lighter vessels was directed to protect
their arrival. This squadron accordingly sailed from
Brest under the command of Rear-Admiral Nielly, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
10th of April.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
It had been preceded by a light division,
whose mission was to meet the convoy and inform the
officer in charge that Nielly would await him a hundred
leagues west of Belle-Isle.</p>

<p>Later news corrected the expectations based upon
Genêt's first despatches, and as the close approach of
summer made it more easy for the British fleet to maintain
its position in the Bay of Biscay, and consequently
increased the dangers through which the convoy must
pass, the French government determined to send out all
the available ships in Brest. On the 16th of May the
great fleet, comprising twenty-five ships-of-the-line, one of
which carried one hundred and twenty guns and three
others one hundred and ten, sailed under the command
of Rear-Admiral Villaret Joyeuse. A representative of
the National Convention, charged with duties resembling
those of the representatives present with the armies in
the field, embarked on board the flag-ship, "La Montagne."
This magnificent vessel, called under the monarchy the
"États de Bourgogne," now bore the name of the terrible
party dominant in the National Convention. These
were still the days of the Terror, and Robespierre had yet
two months to live when the fleet sailed from Brest. The
admiral's orders were to cruise in the same station that
had already been assigned to Nielly, with whom he was
expected to form a junction, and to protect the approach
of the convoy at all hazards, but not to fight unless essential
to secure that end, to which all other objects were
subordinated. The time of waiting was to be utilized
for fleet manœuvres, in which the representative and admiral
had too much reason to fear that the captains were
unskilled.</p>

<p>The anxiety of the French government about the convoy,
and the embarrassment which would be caused by
its loss, were obvious incentives to the British authorities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to do all in their power to intercept it. The Channel fleet,
so called from the ports upon which its operations were
based, had returned from its cruises of the previous year
in December, and had since then remained at anchor,
repairing and refitting for the next year's work. Its commander,
Lord Howe, as has before been said,
<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> was averse
from keeping the sea in winter with the heavy ships. According
to his system of warfare, the fleet should be anchored
at some convenient point on the Channel coast,
and depend upon frigates stationed before the French
ports to bring it word of the enemy's movements. Had,
however, the expected convoy in 1794 sailed from America
as soon as it was expected to do, it would have reached
its own ports before the British had left their anchors.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May the Channel fleet, numbering thirty-four
ships-of-the-line and attended by fifteen frigates and
smaller ships-of-war, sailed from Spithead. It had under
its charge one hundred and forty-eight sail of merchantmen,
bound to Newfoundland and to the East and West
Indies. Upon arriving two days later off the Lizard, a
promontory near the south-west extremity of England and
a hundred miles due north of the Island of Ushant, Howe
detached eight ships-of-the-line to accompany the convoy
to the latitude of Cape Finisterre, on the north-west coast
of Spain. After performing this service, six, under Admiral
Montagu, were to cruise between Cape Ortegal and
the latitude of Belle-Isle, to intercept the convoy from
America. The width, over two hundred miles, of the
belt of ocean to be covered by these six ships with
their accompanying frigates, taken in connection with
the chances which night and fog might give the French
convoy for passing unobserved, illustrates the comparative
disadvantages of lying in wait at the supposed point of
arrival, instead of at the known port of departure, for a
body of vessels whose precise destination is in doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Howe, with the twenty-six ships remaining to him,
steered directly for Ushant, reconnoitred Brest, and, having
ascertained that the bulk of the French fleet was still
in port, proceeded to cruise in the Bay of Biscay, moving
backward and forward across the probable track of the
expected convoy. On the 19th of May he again looked
into Brest, and found that the French had sailed. The
same evening a frigate from Montagu joined him, requesting
a re-enforcement, as the rear-admiral had learned
from a captured vessel that Nielly's squadron was at sea,
and that Van Stabel's force numbered four of the line.
He consequently anticipated the possibility of falling in
with nine ships-of-the-line, which would be too large a
number for his own six to meet. As the frigate, of
course, brought word where Montagu was to be found,
Howe, knowing that the main French fleet was out, steered
at once to join his subordinate; but ascertaining later,
from passing vessels, that Villaret had been seen in a
position and heading a course which would take him well
clear of Montagu, he abandoned this purpose and went
directly in pursuit of the enemy. The latter, by the information
he received, numbered twenty-six ships-of-the-line,
precisely equalling his own fleet.</p>

<p>A week, however, was to elapse before he found the
French. On the morning of the 28th of May, the wind
being then south by west, the lookout frigates signalled
a strange fleet to windward. It proved to be that of
Villaret, then steering north-north-east, nearly before the
wind, in three columns. At the time of this meeting,
Howe was running back to the eastward with a fair
wind, having actually gone a hundred miles west of the
enemy's rendezvous without finding him. The French
admiral stood on until he could recognize the British,
and then hauled to the wind, intending to form his line-of-battle
on the port tack, heading west or a little south
of it. The inexperience of the captains, of whom a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
proportion had no naval training and had never commanded
ships in a fleet, led to a long delay and a poor
formation. Lord Howe, on the contrary, soon had his
fleet in manageable condition, pressing to windward in
two columns on the port tack, and with a flying squadron
of four fast and handy seventy-four-gun ships well to the
windward of the main body. The British fleet was now
steering the same course as the French, to leeward, or
north, of it, and at noon the distance between the main
bodies was from nine to ten miles. The place of this first
meeting was about four hundred miles west (and a little
south) of the island of Ushant. There was a strong
breeze and a moderately heavy sea.</p>

<p>Villaret soon found that the slowness of the formation,
to facilitate which many of his ships had to heave-to,
<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
was causing the line to set gradually to leeward, toward
the British. Four also of his fleet were separated from
the main body, being some distance astern and to windward,
two of them slightly disabled. To approach these,
and at the same time keep the advantage of the wind,
he determined to put the fleet on the other tack. At ten
minutes before two in the afternoon the French began
tacking in succession, and by quarter past three were
all on the starboard tack, heading now east-south-east
toward the separated ships. Meantime, the British flying
squadron, acting independently of the main body, but
under orders to attack the enemy's rear, kept forcing to
windward, and at a little after three o'clock one of them
was able to open fire, just before the rear French ships
went about. The main body tacked between three and
four o'clock, and being now on the same course as the
French, east-south-east, but entirely out of cannon-shot,
carried a press of sail to overtake them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>The ships of the flying squadron, being handled for
the most part with vigor and judgment, fulfilled Howe's
purpose of making an impression upon the <i>rear</i> of the
enemy's column. As soon as the attack became pronounced,
one of the French one-hundred-and-ten-gun ships,
the "Révolutionnaire," took the extreme rear, and upon
her fell the brunt of the action, which lasted this day until
after ten P. M.; daylight, at that time of the year and in
that latitude, continuing till nearly then. The British
advanced ships were joined after some time by two more
from the main body, so that the "Révolutionnaire" had
to encounter, first and last, some half-dozen hostile seventy-fours.
No diagram of this day's fighting need be
given. The reader has only to picture a long column
of ships steering to the southward and eastward, its
rear harassed by the repeated but irregular attacks of a
superior hostile detachment.</p>

<p>The "Révolutionnaire" was nobly fought; and the
concentration upon her, while eminently judicious, served
to bring out vividly the advantage, which should never
be forgotten, of one heavy ship over several smaller, even
though the force of the latter may, in the aggregate, be
much superior. The attacks this day made upon her
were, from the nature of the case, not simultaneous.
They resembled one of those elaborately combined movements
in land warfare, whereby several separate columns
are intended to be brought at the same time to the same
point, but actually arrive one by one and are beaten off
in detail. The result in the present instance was somewhat
more fortunate. As darkness fell, Howe called off
all but two of the assailants,—one having already been
driven off,—in order to form his line for the night. The
"Révolutionnaire" remained in hot action with a small
seventy-four, the "Audacious," alone; for the comrade
of the latter took no share. At ten P. M., having lost
her captain and sixty-two men killed and eighty-six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
wounded, and with her mizzen-mast shot away, she wore
out of action under charge of her fourth lieutenant, the
three seniors having been killed or seriously hurt. Covered
by the dark she passed to the northward, astern of the
British fleet, her remaining masts falling soon after. The
"Audacious" was so badly crippled that it took her long
to get clear of the French line, and she was unable to
rejoin her own that night. The next morning, finding
herself isolated and in presence of some enemy's ships,
she was forced to run before the wind and was permanently
separated from the fleet. The two opponents
passed within sight of each other the following day, but
they were in no condition to resume the encounter, and
both reached port without further injury.</p>

</div>

<p>During the short summer night the two fleets continued
to run on parallel lines (May 29,
<a href="#i-129.jpg">Fig. 1. BB, FF</a>,) south-east
by east, being about three miles apart, the French
bearing south from the British. The latter appear to have
gained somewhat upon their less practised adversaries, so
that at six o'clock Howe, ever intent upon getting to windward
and thereby obtaining the opportunity to attack,
directed his fleet to tack in succession (a), expecting that
the van would on the new course pass near enough to the
enemy's rear to exchange shots. After the evolution, the
British were in column steering west (B'B'), the French
still south-east by east. Villaret, seeing his rear threatened,
wore his fleet in succession at quarter before eight
(b), the van ships running down north-west by west (F'F')
parallel to their previous course, toward the rear of their
own column; upon reaching which the leading ship hauled
to the wind again (c), followed by each of the others in
order. These two manœuvres brought both fleets once
more heading in the same direction, following parallel
courses and abreast each other; the French still to windward,
but having lost much of the distance which separated
them from their enemies. A few shots had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
exchanged, as Howe expected, between the British van and
the French rear as they passed on opposite tacks
(<a href="#i-129.jpg">Fig. 1, d</a>).</p>

<p>Toward ten o'clock the French head ships ran down
toward the British van and opened fire at long range,
their centre and rear keeping out of action (May 29,
<a href="#i-129.jpg">Fig. 2</a>.)
The leading British ship, "Cæsar," failed to carry
sail enough, though repeatedly signalled to make more;
and in consequence those astern of her had also to shorten
sail, the flag-ship "Queen Charlotte" in particular being
forced to leeward by the necessity of backing a topsail to
keep in her station. At noon there was a brisk cannonade
between the two vans. Dissatisfied with this partial engagement,
which, by crippling some of his ships, might put
out of his power to reach the enemy, Howe at noon signalled
to tack again in succession, and to pass through the
French line. The "Cæsar," which should have begun the
manœuvre, made no reply, and it was necessary to repeat
the order. Shortly before one o'clock she wore instead of
tacking. The ships between her and the admiral also went
about; but none, save the "Queen," of ninety-eight guns,
second in the order, appears to have reached the hostile
line, except at its extreme rear. She passed alone, and
for a long time unsupported, along a considerable portion
of the enemy's order, which had now been re-established
by the centre and rear bearing down to support the van
(<a href="#i-129.jpg">Fig. 2, a</a>);
but she was unable to break through, owing at
first to the closeness of the French ships to each other, and
afterwards to the injuries received from their successive
broadsides. The "Cæsar" kept so far from the wind as
to neutralize the admiral's purpose; and of the other van
ships all went to leeward of the French line, none breaking
through. So far, therefore, the general result was only to
bring confusion into the British order without attaining
the end which Howe desired. He therefore determined
to set the example, directed the flag-ship to be tacked
(<a href="#i-129.jpg">Fig. 2, b</a>),
and stood under a press of sail toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
French line, closely followed by two others, the next ahead
and next astern of him. The "Queen Charlotte," which
had been tenth in the British column, reached the enemy
at a point not far in rear of Villaret's flag-ship, and ran
along the line (<a href="#i-131.jpg">Fig. 3</a>)
till she came abreast of the sixth
ship from the rear, astern of which she luffed through and
gained to windward of the French
(<a href="#i-129.jpg">Fig. 3, a</a>). One of her
two followers passed through the second interval (b) behind
that pierced by herself, and the other through the
next (c),—that is, between the third and second vessel
from the enemy's rear. The two remaining French ships,
the "Indomptable" (I), of eighty guns, and the "Tyrannicide"
(T), of seventy-four, were not only far astern but to
leeward of their line. They were therefore easily to be
reached by several of the British, who gradually encircled
them.</p>

</div>

<p>With his rear thus for the third time threatened, and
much more seriously than before, Villaret again made
signal to wear in succession. The French van had by now
become much separated from the rest of the fleet, and the
leading ship was too disabled to go about. No other taking
the initiative, the admiral, like Howe, was forced to set
the example. The "Montagne" (M) wore out of line (d),
and led down toward the two surrounded ships, with a
signal flying to follow and form in her wake (F' F') without
regard to usual station. This movement of Villaret not
only tended to release the "Indomptable" and "Tyrannicide,"
but also threatened the "Queen" (Q), which had
fallen to leeward disabled. Howe, after getting to windward
and tacking (e), had endeavored to reach the
"Terrible," of one hundred and ten guns, carrying the
flag of the admiral commanding the French rear, which
had been astern of the point at which the "Queen Charlotte"
broke the line; but, while the "Charlotte" was
putting about, the "Terrible" (Te) passed ahead and
reached the centre of Villaret's column before Howe's ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
could come up with her. For every reason, therefore, but
especially for the safety of the "Queen," it became imperative
for the British admiral to reverse his course. He
therefore wore (f), gathering round him by signal all
vessels within reach, and again stood east, toward the
threatened ships of the two parties,—running in a
column parallel to, but to windward of, that of the French
admiral.</p>

<p>The "Queen," though much crippled, had, with her
head to the eastward, passed astern of the two threatened
French ships. These had suffered from the engagement,
in passing, with the British van a few hours before, as
well as with the flying squadron on the previous day; and
the injuries then received had doubtless contributed to
place them in the exposed and dangerous position they
now occupied. The "Leviathan," seventy-four, attacked
them to windward, the "Orion," of the same class, to
leeward, and the latter was soon after re-enforced and
replaced by the "Barfleur," of ninety-eight guns. No
particular statement is given in the British narratives of
other ships attacking these two, but several of those astern
of the "Queen Charlotte," which could have reached no
other of the French, lost killed and wounded, and it is
probable that these shared in this encounter. The French
accounts speak of their two vessels as "surrounded;" and
Villaret wrote that their resistance "should immortalize
their captains, Dordelin and Lamesle." They came out of
the engagement of the 29th of May with only their lower
masts standing; and the heavier of the two, the "Indomptable,"
was in such condition that Villaret thought necessary
to send her to Brest that night, escorted by another of
his fleet, which was thus dwindling piece-meal.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, the French admiral's manœuvre,
well conceived and gallantly executed, rescued the
endangered ships. The "Queen Charlotte" and her immediate
supporters, after first tacking, had barely reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the rear of the French. As the latter continued to stand
on, it was of course impossible for all the fifteen ships behind
the British admiral to come up with them at once.
In fact, the failure of the van to do its whole duty, combined
with the remote position of the rear,—increased probably
by the straggling usually to be observed at the tail of
long columns,—had resulted in throwing the British order
into confusion. "As the ships arrived," wrote Lord Howe
in his journal, "they came up so crowded together as
afforded an opportunity for the enemy to have fired upon
them with great advantage."
(<a href="#i-131.jpg">Fig. 3, C, R</a>.) "The British
line was completely deformed," states one French authority.
But, though disordered, they formed a large and
dangerous body, all within supporting distance,—they had
on their side the prestige of an indisputable, though partial,
success,—they were flushed with victory, and it would
appear that the French van had not yet come up. Villaret
therefore contented himself with carrying off his rescued
ships, with which and with the rest of his fleet he stood
away to the north-west.</p>

<p>It is desirable to sum up the result of these two days of
partial encounters, as an important factor in the discussion
of the campaign as a whole, which must shortly follow.
On the morning of May 28, the French numbered twenty-six
ships-of-the-line<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and were, when they first formed
line, from ten to twelve miles to windward of the British,
also numbering twenty-six. On the evening of May 29,
in consequence of Howe's various movements and the
course to which Villaret was by them constrained,—for he
acted purely on the defensive and had to conform to the
initiative of the enemy,—the French fleet was to leeward
of the British. As Howe had succeeded within so short a
time in forcing action from to leeward, there was every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
reason to apprehend that from the windward position—decidedly
the more favorable upon the whole, though not
without its drawbacks—he would be able to compel a
decisive battle, which the French naval policy proscribed
generally, and in the present case particularly. Besides
this adverse change of circumstance, the balance of loss
was still more against the French. On the first day the
"Révolutionnaire" on one side and the "Audacious" on
the other had been compelled to quit their fleets; but the
force of the latter was not over two thirds that of the
former. By the action of the 29th the "Indomptable," of
eighty guns, was driven from the French fleet, and the
admiral thought necessary to send with her a seventy-four
and a frigate. The "Tyrannicide," seventy-four, had lost
all her upper masts; she had consequently to be towed by
one of her consorts through the next two days and in the
battle of the First of June. If Villaret had had any expectation
of escaping Howe's pursuit, the presence of this
disabled ship would have destroyed it, unless he was willing
to abandon her. Besides the mishaps already stated, the
leading ship, "Montagnard," had been so much injured in
the early part of the engagement that she could not go
about. Continuing to stand west, while the body of the
fleet was running east to the aid of the "Indomptable" and
"Tyrannicide," this ship separated from her consorts and
was not able to regain them. To this loss of four ships
actually gone, and one permanently crippled, may be added
that of the "Audacieux," one of Nielly's squadron, which
joined on the morning of the 29th, but was immediately detached
to seek and protect the "Révolutionnaire." On the
other hand, the British had by no means escaped unscathed;
but on the morning of the 30th, in reply to an interrogatory
signal from the admiral, they all reported readiness to
renew the action, except one, the "Cæsar," which was not
among the most injured. This ship, however, did not leave
the fleet, and was in her station in the battle of the First.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>The merit of Howe's conduct upon these two days does
not, however, depend merely upon the issue, though fortunate.
By persistent attacks, frequently renewed upon
the same and most vulnerable part of the French order, he
had in effect brought to bear a large part of his own fleet
upon a relatively small number of the enemy, the result
being a concentration of injury which compelled the damaged
ships to leave the field. At the same time the direction
of the attack forced the French admiral either to
abandon the endangered vessels, or step by step to yield
the advantage of the wind until it was finally wrested from
him altogether. By sheer tactical skill, combined with a
fine display of personal conduct, Howe had won a marked
numerical preponderance for the decisive action, which he
now had good reason to expect from the advantageous
position likewise secured. Unfortunately, the tactical gain
was soon neutralized by the strategic mistake which left
Montagu's squadron unavailable on the day of battle.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the day the weather grew thick,
and so continued, with short intervals of clearing, for the
next thirty-six hours. At half-past seven the body of the
French bore from the British flag-ship north-west, distant
nine or ten miles; both fleets standing very slowly to the
westward and a little northerly, with wind from the southward
and westward. During most of the 30th, none of the
British fleet could be seen from the flag-ship, but they all,
as well as the French, kept together. On that day also, by
a piece of great good fortune considering the state of the
weather, Admiral Nielly joined Villaret with the three ships
still under his command, as did also another seventy-four belonging
to the Cancale squadron. These four fresh ships
exactly replaced the four disabled ones that had parted
company, and again made the French twenty-six to Howe's
twenty-five.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock in the morning of May 31st, the fog
lifted for a moment, allowing Howe to count twenty-seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
sail of his ships and frigates; and, after again shutting
down for a couple of hours, it finally dispersed shortly after
noon. The French were then seen bearing from west to
north-west. The British made sail in chase and by six <span class="sc">P.M.</span>
had approached to within about three miles. They were
not, however, able to reach the position Howe wished—abreast
the enemy—early enough to permit the intended
general engagement, unless by a night action; which for
more than one reason the admiral was not willing to undertake.
He therefore hauled again to the wind, heading to
the westward in order of battle. The French had formed
on a parallel line and were running in the same direction.
During the night both fleets carried all the sail their masts
would stand. In the morning the French, thanks to the
better sailing of their vessels, were found to have gained
somewhat on their enemies, but not sufficiently to avoid or
postpone the battle, which they had been directed if possible
to shun. Villaret therefore formed his fleet in close
order, and stood on slowly under short canvas, which at
once allowed irregularities in the order to be more easily
corrected and also left the crews free to devote themselves
exclusively to fighting the ships. Howe, by carrying sail,
was thus able to choose his position prior to bearing down.
Having reached it and formed his line, the French being
now hove-to to await the attack, the British fleet was also
hove-to, and the crews went to breakfast. At twelve minutes
past eight it again filled-away by signal, and stood
slowly down for the enemy
(June 1, <a href="#i-129.jpg">Fig. 1</a>). The intention
being to attack along the whole line, ship to ship,
advantage was taken of this measured approach to change
the place of the three-decked ships in the order, so that
they should be opposed to the heaviest of the French.
Lord Howe, who in the matter of drill was something of a
precisian, is said to have rectified the alignment of his
fleet more than once as it stood down; and, unless some
such delay took place, it is difficult to reconcile the rate of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
sailing of the ships with the time it took them to cover the
ground. The combatants had a long summer's day before
them, and such scrupulous care was not wholly out of
place in an attack of the kind; for not only was it desirable
that the shock should be felt everywhere at once, but
ships in advance of the line would invite concentration of
fire from the enemy, while those much in the rear would
be embarrassed by smoke concealing the position it behooved
them to take.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-137.jpg" id="i-137.jpg"></a>
<img src="images/i-137.jpg"

<div class="caption">Battle of the First of June, 1794.<br />
<a href="images/i-137hr.jpg"><span class="disp">Click here for larger map</span></a></div>
</div>

<p>This difficulty from smoke was the more to be feared
because Howe's plan, as communicated to the fleet by
signal, was not merely to attack on the side from which
he approached, but to pass through the intervals between
the enemy's ships, and to engage them on the further,
or lee, side. This method conferred the advantage of a
raking fire<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
while passing through the line, and cut off
the retreat of disabled enemies; for a crippled ship could
only retire to leeward.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> To carry out the design, however,
required not only that the enemy should leave wide
enough intervals, but also that the assailants should be
able to see where the intervals were.</p>

<p>The British ships were steering each for its opposite
in the enemy's order, heading about north-west; so that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
as the French line was east and west, the approach was
not perpendicular but in a slanting direction. At twenty
minutes before nine, the formation was so accurate that
Lord Howe shut the signal book with an air of satisfaction,
as though his work as admiral was done and all
that remained was to show the gallant bearing and example
which had ever been associated with his name.
The gesture was, however, premature, and eccentricities
of conduct on the part of some captains compelled him
again to open the book and order them into their stations.
Shortly after nine o'clock the French van began firing.
The British ship "Cæsar," on the left flank of her line,
and therefore corresponding to the leader of the French,
instead of pressing on to her station for battle, hauled to
the wind and began firing while still five hundred yards
distant,—a position inconsistent with decisive results under
the gunnery conditions of that day. Lord Howe, who
had not thought well of the captain of this ship, but had
permitted him to retain his distinguished position in the
order at the request of the captain of the "Queen Charlotte,"
now tapped the latter on the shoulder, and said,
"Look, Curtis, there goes your friend; who is mistaken
now?"</p>

<p>The rest of the fleet stood on. The "Queen Charlotte,"
in order to reach her position, had to steer somewhat more
to the westward. Either the French line had drawn a
little ahead, or some other incident had thrown this ship
astern of her intended point of arrival. Her course, therefore,
becoming more nearly parallel to the enemy's, she
passed within range of the third vessel behind Villaret's
flag-ship, the "Montagne," her destined opponent. This
ship, the "Vengeur," opened fire upon her at half-past
nine. The "Queen Charlotte," not to be crippled before
reaching her place, made more sail and passed on. The
next ahead of the "Vengeur," the "Achille," also engaged
her, and to this the "Charlotte" replied at eight minutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
before ten. The assailant suffered severely, and her attention
was quickly engrossed by the "Brunswick," the
supporter of Howe's flag-ship on her starboard side, which
tried to break through the line ahead of the "Achille."</p>

<p>The "Queen Charlotte" (June 1,
<a href="#i-129.jpg">Fig. 2, C</a>) continued
on for the "Montagne" (M). Seeing her evident purpose
to pass under the stern, the captain of this ship threw his
sails aback, so as to fall to the rear and close the interval.
At the same moment the French ship next astern, the
"Jacobin," increased her sail, most properly, for the same
object. The two thus moving towards each other, a collision
was threatened. As the only alternative, the "Jacobin"
put her helm up and steered for the starboard, or
lee, side of the "Montagne." At this moment the "Queen
Charlotte" drew up. Putting her helm hard over, she
kept away perpendicularly to the "Montagne," and passed
under her stern, so close that the French flag brushed the
side of the British ship. One after another the fifty guns
of the latter's broadside swept from stern to stem of the
enemy,—three hundred of her crew falling at once, her
captain among the number. The "Jacobin" having moved
to the starboard side of the "Montagne," in the place the
"Queen Charlotte" had intended to take, it was thought
that the latter would have to go to leeward of both; but,
amid all the confusion of the scene, the quick eye of the
gallant man who was directing her movements caught a
glimpse of the "Jacobin's" rudder and saw it moving to
change the ship's direction to leeward. Quickly seizing
his opportunity, the helm of the British flag-ship was again
shifted, and she came slowly and heavily to the wind in her
appointed place, her jib-boom in the movement just clearing
the "Jacobin," as her side a few minutes before had
grazed the flag of the "Montagne." The latter, it is said,
made no reply to this deadly assault. The "Jacobin" fired
a few shots, one of which cut away the foretopmast of the
"Queen Charlotte;" and then, instead of imitating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
latter's movement and coming to the wind again, by which
the British ship would have been placed between his fire
and that of the "Montagne," the captain weakly kept off
and ran to leeward out of action.</p>

<p>By this time the engagement was general all along the
line (<a href="#i-129.jpg">Fig. 2</a>).
Smoke, excitement and the difficulties of
the situation broke somewhat the simultaneousness of the
shock of the British assault; but, with some exceptions,
their fire from van to rear opened at nearly the same time.
Six ships only passed at once through the enemy's line,
but very many of the others brought their opponents to
close action to windward. In this, the first pitched battle
after many years of peace, there were found the inevitable
failures in skill, the more sorrowful shortcomings of many
a fair-seeming man. To describe minutely the movements
of every ship would not tend to clearness, but to obscurity.
For general impression of the scene at certain distinctive
moments the reader is referred to the diagrams; in which,
also, an attempt has been made to represent the relative
motions of the ships in both squadrons, so far as can
be probably deduced from the narratives. (See Figs.
<a href="#i-129.jpg">2</a>
and <a href="#i-131.jpg">3</a>.)</p>

<p>There was, however, one episode of so singular, so
deadly, and yet so dramatic an interest, occurring in the
midst of this extensive <i>mêlée</i>, that it cannot be passed by.
As long as naval history shall be written, it must commemorate
the strife between the French ship "Vengeur
du Peuple" and the British ship "Brunswick." The latter
went into action on the right hand of the "Queen Charlotte;"
its duty therefore was to pierce the French line
astern of the "Jacobin." This was favored by the movement
of the latter to support the "Montagne;" but, as the
"Brunswick" pressed for the widened gap, the "Achille"
made sail ahead and threw herself in the way. Foiled
here, the "Brunswick" again tried to traverse the line
astern of the "Achille," but the "Vengeur" now came up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and, as the "Brunswick" persisted, the two collided and
swung side to side, the anchors of the British ship hooking
in the rigging and channels of the French. Thus fastened
in deadly embrace, they fell off before the wind and went
away together to leeward
(Fig. <a href="#i-129.jpg">2, B</a>).</p>

<p>As the contact of the two ships prevented opening the
lower ports as usual, the British crew blew off the lids.
The "Vengeur" having already been firing from the side
engaged, hers were probably open; but, owing to the hulls
touching, it was not possible to use the ordinary sponges
and rammers, with rigid wooden staves, and the French
had no other. The British, however, were specially provided
for such a case with sponges and rammers having
flexible rope handles, and with these they were able to
carry on the action. In this way the contest continued
much to the advantage of the British on the lower decks,
where the French, for the reason given, could use only a
few of the forward and after guns, the form of a ship at
the extremities causing the distance there between the
combatants to be greater. But while such an inequality existed
below, above the balance was reversed; the heavy
carronades of the "Vengeur," loaded with langrage, and
the superiority of her musketry,—re-enforced very probably
by the men from the useless cannon below,—beating
down the resistance of the British crew on the upper deck
and nearly silencing their guns. The captain of the
"Brunswick" received three wounds, from one of which
he afterwards died; and a number of others, both officers
and men, were killed and wounded. This circumstance
encouraged the "Vengeur's" commander to try to carry
his opponent by boarding; but, when about to execute the
attempt, the approach of two other British ships necessitated
calling off the men, to serve the guns on the hitherto
disengaged side.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the "Brunswick's" crew maintained an unremitting
fire, giving to their guns alternately extreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
elevation and depression, so that at one discharge the shot
went up through the "Vengeur's" decks, ripping them
open, while at the other they tended to injure the bottom.
The fight had thus continued for an hour when the
"Achille," with only her foremast standing, was seen
approaching the "Brunswick" on her port, or disengaged,
side. The threatened danger was promptly met and successfully
averted. Before the new enemy could take a
suitable position, half-a-dozen guns' crews on each of the
lower decks shifted to the side on which she was, and in a
few moments their fire brought down her only remaining
and already damaged mast. The "Achille" had no farther
part in the battle and was taken possession of by the
British a few hours later.</p>

<p>At quarter before one the uneasy motions of the two
ships wrenched the anchors one after another from the
"Brunswick's" side, and after a grapple of three hours
they separated. The character of the contest, as described,
had caused the injury to fall mainly upon the hulls and
crews, while the spars and rigging, contrary to the usual
result in so fierce an action, had largely escaped. As they
were parting, the "Brunswick" poured a few final shots
into the "Vengeur's" stern, injuring the rudder, and increasing
the leaks from which the doomed ship was already
suffering. Immediately afterwards the mizzen-mast of the
British vessel went overboard; and, being already well to
leeward of her own fleet and threatened by the approach
of the French admiral, she stood to the northward under
such sail as her spars would bear, intending to make a
home port, if possible. In this long and desperate conflict,
besides the injuries to be expected to hull and spars,
the "Brunswick" had twenty-three of her seventy-four guns
dismounted, and had lost forty-four killed and one hundred
and fourteen wounded out of a crew of six hundred men.
<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after the dismasting of the "Achille," the British
ship "Ramillies," commanded by the brother of the "Brunswick's"
captain, had been seen coming slowly down toward
the two combatants. She arrived but a few moments before
their separation, and, when they were far enough apart
for her fire not to endanger the "Brunswick," she also
attacked the "Vengeur," but not long after left her again in
order to secure the "Achille." This fresh onslaught, however,
brought down all the "Vengeur's" masts except the
mizzen, which stood for half an hour longer. The French
ship was helpless. With numerous shot-holes at or near
the water line, with many of her port lids gone, she was
rolling heavily in the waves, unsteadied by masts, and taking
in water on all sides. Guns were thrown overboard,
pumps worked and assisted by bailing, but all in vain,—the
"Vengeur" was slowly but surely sinking. At half-past
one the danger was so evident that signals of distress were
made; but among the disabled or preoccupied combatants
they for a long time received no attention. About six <span class="sc">P.M</span>.,
fortunately, two British ships and a cutter drew near, and
upon learning the state of the case sent all their boats that
remained unhurt. It was too late to save every survivor of
this gallant fight, but nearly four hundred were taken off;
the remainder, among whom were most of the badly
wounded, went down with their ship before the British
boats had regained their own. "Scarcely had the boats
pulled clear of the sides, when the most frightful spectacle
was offered to our gaze. Those of our comrades who remained
on board the 'Vengeur du Peuple,' with hands
raised to Heaven, implored with lamentable cries the help
for which they could no longer hope. Soon disappeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the ship and the unhappy victims which it contained. In
the midst of the horror with which this scene inspired us
all, we could not avoid a feeling of admiration mingled
with our grief. As we drew away, we heard some of our
comrades still making prayers for the welfare of their
country; the last cries of these unfortunates were: 'Vive
la République!' They died uttering them."

<a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> A touching
picture of brave men meeting an inevitable fate, after doing
all that energy and courage could to avoid it; very different
from the melodramatic mixture of tinsel verbiage and
suicide which found favor with the National Convention,
and upon which the "Legend of the Vengeur" was based.

<a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Of the seven hundred and twenty-three who composed
her crew, three hundred and fifty-six were lost; two hundred
and fifty of whom were, by the survivors, believed to
have been killed or wounded in the three actions.</p>

<p>Long before the "Vengeur" and the "Brunswick" separated,
the fate of the battle had been decided, and the
final action of the two commanders-in-chief taken. It was
just ten o'clock when the British flag-ship passed under the
stern of the "Montagne." At ten minutes past ten the
latter, whose extensive injuries were mainly to the hull,
made sail in advance,—a movement which the "Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Charlotte," having lost both fore and main topmasts, was
unable to follow. Many of the French ships ahead of
the "Montagne" had already given ground and left their
posts; others both before and behind her had been dismasted.
Between half-past ten and eleven the smoke
cleared sufficiently for Villaret to see the situation on the
field of battle.</p>

<p>Ships dismasted not only lose their power of motion, but
also do not drift to leeward as rapidly as those whose spars
are up, but which are moving very slowly. In consequence,
the lines having some movement ahead, the dismasted
ships of both parties had tended astern and to windward
of the battle. There they lay, British and French, pell-mell
together. Of the twelve ahead of the French admiral
when the battle began, seven had soon run out of action
to leeward. Two of these, having hauled to the wind on
the other tack, were now found to be astern and to windward
of both fleets; to windward even of the dismasted
ships. Of the rest of the twelve, one, having lost main
and mizzen masts, was unavoidably carried to leeward, and
the remaining four were totally dismasted. Of these four,
three finally fell into the hands of the British. Of the
thirteen ships astern of the "Montagne," six had lost all
their masts, and one had only the foremast standing; the
remaining six had their spars left in fairly serviceable condition,
and had, some sooner and some later, retreated to
leeward. Four of the dismasted ships in the rear, including
among them the "Vengeur," were captured by the
British.</p>

<p>When Admiral Villaret Joyeuse had recognized the situation,
as thus briefly described, he directed the "Montagne"
also to be headed to leeward, and made signals to gather
the serviceable ships round the commander-in-chief. A
column of twelve was thus formed
(June 1, <a href="#i-131.jpg">Fig. 3, F' F'</a>)
on the starboard tack, standing, that is, to the eastward
again,—the "Montagne" leading and the rear being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
brought up by the "Terrible," the flag-ship of the second
in command, which had only her foremast left and was
therefore taken in tow by an uninjured seventy-four. Villaret
considered it imprudent, if not impossible, to get far
enough to windward to interpose in favor of the dismasted
vessels. He determined, therefore, to place himself to leeward
of them, in such position as to receive and cover
those that could run down to him, or which his frigates
could reach and tow away. In this manner the "Scipion,"
the "Jemappes," and the "Mucius," totally disabled, were
restored to the French fleet between two and four o'clock.
The last named had actually struck to a British ship, but
had not been taken into possession. Villaret remained for
some time, hove-to in this position, until satisfied that no
more of the separated vessels could join him, and then
made sail to the north-west (F" F").
<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Lord Howe was unable to follow with his own ship
the comparatively rapid movements of the French commander-in-chief.
At eleven o'clock, however, a signal was
made for those that could to close around the admiral,
and the "Queen Charlotte" was with difficulty put on
the other tack. Howe then led the column thus formed
(B' B') to the eastward, a step that was necessary not
only in order to cover dismantled British ships and secure
the prizes, but also to relieve the "Queen," which
was threatened by Villaret and in a critical situation.
This ship, which had behaved with so much forwardness
and gallantry in the British van on the 29th of May,
had on the First of June been stationed in the rear. The
antagonist which she attacked went away rapidly to leeward;
and the "Queen," following with unrelenting ardor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
found herself at the end of the engagement again
between the lines, with a dismantled enemy, indeed, near
by, but with her own mainmast gone and other spars tottering.
Eight of Villaret's column cannonaded her as
they passed, but without doing much harm, and Howe's
approach extricated her.</p>

<p>The escape of some of the French dismasted ships was
severely criticised at the time, and there was also an opinion
that Howe should have renewed the attack after gathering
about him his less injured vessels. There can be
little question that more promptitude and energy would
have secured some of the French that got away; many
competent eye-witnesses thought so, and much discontent
was openly expressed in the fleet. It is more doubtful
whether the admiral would have done well to order the
attack renewed. Several captains had behaved indifferently,
either through lack of judgment or lack of nerve,
and the best were naturally among those whose ships, being
well-placed and hard-fought, were now out of condition
for fighting. A decisive practical reason for ceasing
the action is to be found in Howe's physical condition.
He was then sixty-eight years old; and, although possessed
of the calm, unworrying temper which bears responsibility
lightly, he had undergone great fatigue during the five
days of battle and chase,—his only resting-place from
the time the enemy was encountered being an arm-chair.
"When the report was brought to him," says the signal
lieutenant, "that the French fleet showed every symptom
of determination to sustain a battle, I watched his face
when he came to the quarter-deck to look at them; it expressed
an animation of which, at his age, and after such
fatigue of mind and body, I had not thought it capable;"
but the reaction came possibly a little too soon for reaping
the full fruits of the victory. "He went to bed," wrote
the same officer, "completely done up after the action
of the First. We all got round him; indeed, I saved him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
from a tumble; he was so weak that from a roll of the
ship he was nearly falling into the waist. 'Why, you hold
me up as if I were a child,' he said good-humoredly."
<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
It is not surprising that, under such circumstances, he
could not do all that a younger man might, nor that he
yielded to the influence of his chief-of-staff, Sir Roger
Curtis, a distinguished and gallant officer, but who appears
to have been more impressed than was his superior by the
disadvantages under which the British fleet labored.</p>

<p>Many years later, Admiral Stopford, who commanded a
frigate in the action, made the following statement, which
he allowed to be published: "Having observed the 'Marlborough'
dismasted and surrounded by enemy's ships, I
bore down and took her in tow,—which bringing me very
near the 'Queen Charlotte,' I went on board for orders.
The cool, collected manner in which I was received by Lord
Howe, and the desire he expressed to get the ships set to
rights to continue the action, showed that such was his intention;
and for the purpose of exonerating Lord Howe's
memory from the charges I have heard alleged against
him for not following up his victory, I think it right to
state that, when standing on the 'Queen Charlotte's'
poop, close to Lord Howe, Sir Roger Curtis came up in
haste and apparent perturbation, exclaiming, 'I declare to
God, my Lord, if you don't assemble the fleet, they will
turn the tables upon us.' I must confess that I did not
see anything to warrant such an exclamation, except a
French ship passing under the 'Queen Charlotte's' stern
and firing a few guns into her. The admiral and Sir
R. Curtis then retired to another part of the poop, and
nothing more was done."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The responsibility of a commander-in-chief is not affected
by the advice given him by any subordinate, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
high his reputation or confidential the relations
between them; but in the state of bodily weakness from
which Howe suffered, he must, for subsequent action, have
depended largely upon Curtis, and it was probably well
not to undertake an undeniable risk against the judgment
of the officer who might be called upon to superintend the
operation. The battle therefore terminated with the movement
of the two commanders-in-chief, with their serviceable
ships, to the eastward, through which three French
vessels escaped, the "Queen" was extricated, and seven
dismasted enemies were cut off by the British. At quarter
past one the general firing ceased, though a few random
shots continued to be exchanged by scattered vessels.</p>

<p>Such were the principal features of the battle of the
First of June, 1794, which, being fought so far from any
land,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
has received no other distinctive name. It has not
been thought desirable to attempt narrating, in words, the
innumerable incidents of the fight. While avoiding a superfluity
of details, however, a tactical analysis of the
course of the action may be not uninteresting to the professional
reader. The method of attack undertaken by
Lord Howe, single ship against single ship, was identical
with that employed on many previous occasions by British
admirals, and is to be justified only by the evidence he had
received, on the 28th and 29th of May, of the enemy's professional
incompetency and indifferent gunnery. He was
probably right in concluding, from the events of those
days, as was decisively proved by the issue on June 1st,
that the French line was at every point weaker than the
ships he could thus bring against it. Under such conditions
it may be permissible to the assailant to throw away
the opportunity, which the offensive gives him, of combining
an attack in superior force upon a part of the enemy's
order. It is very possible that Howe might have reaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
better results by making such a combination, for the tactical
inefficiency of the French fleet, which he had observed,
assured him that it could not, in the moment of action,
remedy any disadvantage under which he might place it;
but, on the other hand, the drill of his own captains was
not yet very good, nor were they all tried men upon whom
he could depend. It was, therefore, not improbable that
an attempt to execute a combination would result in a
muddle, whereas he could count upon superior seamanship
and superior gunnery, ship to ship, and the movement of
approach which he made, though somewhat difficult in
execution, is perfectly simple in idea. Upon the whole,
weighing the pros and cons, it is the opinion of the author
that Howe judged soundly in directing the simple attack
that he did.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>It is instructive to observe that the results of the movement,
though far more decisive in this than in previous
battles, are, upon dissection, found to be closely analogous.
The British fleet, in running down together, was ranged
on a line parallel to the French, but steering a course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
(north-west) that was oblique to its own front as well as
to that of the enemy. The issue in every other instance
had been indecisive,—scarcely ever was a ship taken or
sunk. But while in this respect different, the experience
of previous engagements was otherwise repeated. That
flank of the assailant which in column had been the van
came, as a whole, promptly and orderly into action, while
delay and disorder, attended with imperfect execution, ensued
in the rear. This feature of simultaneous fleet attacks
was emphasized by the strenuous and brilliant efforts
of three of the rear division, which prevented indeed a
general failure there, but brought out all the more clearly
how great the shortcoming would have been but for their
exertions, unparalleled in former battles. The proportion
of loss undergone in the different parts of the British column
gives a fair measure of the vigor displayed by each.
This test is indeed most misleading as a means of comparison
between any two single ships. Instances can readily
be chosen, from this very case, in which vessels skilfully
placed and vigorously fought received less injury than
others, which were badly handled and did little harm to
the enemy; but when an average is taken of many ships,
the specific causes of error in different directions tend to
balance each other, and if the general conclusion is confirmed
by the experience of other battles, it may be accepted
with much confidence. Now, on the First of June,
taking the total number of casualties in the British fleet,
it will be found that in every hundred men killed the
eight van ships lost forty-three, and in every hundred
wounded forty-one; whereas the eight rear lost seventeen
killed and twenty-two wounded, or rather less than half
the proportion of the van. Nor does this tell the whole
story, for four fifths of the entire loss of the rear fell upon
the three vessels,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
leaving but eight killed and thirty-three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
wounded to be divided among the remaining five; whereas,
in the eight van ships, though there are marked individual
differences, the loss is much more equally divided. The
inference, were the truth not otherwise known, would
amount almost to proof that the van ships went down in
good order, attacked vigorously, and so afforded mutual
support, whereas the rear, whatever the cause, did not
impress themselves strongly on the enemy's line; while
the exceptional casualties of the three which did their
duty well indicate a lack of support from the others, which
also appears to be confirmed by the ascertained facts.</p>

<p>When a result is thus reproduced in various battles, it
cannot be attributed wholly to the fault of the captains.
The exceptions to the rule on the First of June were not
the rear ships which failed in gaining for themselves a fair
share in the action, but those which succeeded in so doing.
The cause of this usual result seems to be that the van
ship is the pivot upon which the operation hinges, and in
proportion as the distance from the pivot grows greater,
irregularities become more frequent, while each one that
occurs is propagated and increased, until at last, in a long
line, an approach to disorder ensues. When this happens,
the efficiency of each ship depends less upon her normal
relations to the line than upon the initiative of her captain;
and the differences between men, which had been
controlled by the exigencies of the order, where it still
existed, begin to tell. Short lines will suffer less than
long ones from this cause; whence it follows that in a long
line new pivots, or points of departure for the order beyond
them, should be provided. On the 1st of June the
"Queen Charlotte," by her steady action and the authority
conveyed by the example of the commander-in-chief, served
as such a pivot, and the conduct of the ships on her right
was better than that of those on her immediate left, which
were regulating their position by the van.
<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> As it seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
probable, from the character of modern ships and weapons,
that attacks will be made in a line of front, it is a matter
of interest to naval officers to provide against this tendency
to disorder and imperfect execution, which seems to inhere
in the part of an order distant from the guide, or pivot.</p>

<p>The French line, by awaiting Howe's attack, laid itself
open to any combination he might see fit to make, but the
plan actually adopted threw the burden of resistance upon
the individual captains, rather than upon the admiral.
Whenever a ship was vigorously attacked by an enemy,
her captain's task was simple, however arduous; nor does
there seem to have been an instance of a French officer
in this position failing to do his duty manfully. The superior
gunnery of the British at this time, however, generally
beat down the resistance of the opponent, and the latter
then bore up and ran to leeward, unless his masts had been
shot away, or unless the assailant by piercing the line had
barred retreat. Thus the "Mucius," seventh in the line,
was engaged to leeward by the "Defence." She tried,
therefore, to escape by passing to windward of the British
"Marlborough," next ahead, but fell on board of her and
there lost all her masts. This circumstance of inferior
gunnery, together with the fixed idea of keeping the line
closed, appear to have governed the movements of the
French ships after the battle joined. Now the duty of
keeping the line closed is most important and essential to
mutual support, but it is not paramount to every other consideration,
particularly when an action, as this inevitably
must, had passed into a <i>mêlée</i>; but the French captains,
having few other ideas on fleet-fighting, clung to this one
in its simplest form,—that of following close upon the
heels of the next ahead. Thus the leading ship, "Convention,"
though not hotly attacked, wore out of the line and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
was closely followed by the "Gasparin," though the latter
was vigorously engaged. The next five ships were hard
pressed and fought manfully. The eighth, after a short
engagement, ran to leeward and was followed by the three
astern of her. This brings us to the twelfth, or nearly
to the centre of the French line, and of the six that
followed, down to and including the seventeenth, four were
taken after a desperate resistance. The two that escaped
were the flag-ship "Montagne," whose career has already
been told, and the "Jacobin," next astern of her. The
eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth seem to have received
little injury, but yet ran to leeward; whether independently,
or one following another, does not certainly
appear. The remaining six suffered the fierce assault of
the three of the enemy's rear, and four were reduced to
such a condition that they must have been taken—and
not two only of them—had the rest of the British division
done their full duty.</p>

<p>Although the French officers, lacking both experience
and instruction in fleet warfare, failed to do all they might
in the battle, distinct misconduct by doing what should not
have been done appears only in two cases. The first was
the captain of the leading ship, for whose act in forsaking
his post in the van no good reason appears. The second
and much more serious fault was committed by the captain
of the "Jacobin." The course of this officer in making
sail to close upon the flag-ship, when the intention of the
"Queen Charlotte" to pass between the two became evident,
was perfectly proper. His keeping away, when collision
with the "Montagne" threatened, was probably the
only way of avoiding a disaster. Being thus forced to leeward
of the line, he still retained the power of attacking
the British ship to starboard, while she was, or should have
been, engaged on the other side by the "Montagne." Instead
of using this opportunity, Captain Gassin kept off and
ran to leeward. This fault, grave in any case, was especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
blameworthy in the next astern or next ahead of the
commander-in-chief. Those were posts of peculiar honor,
held by heavy vessels, chosen with the special object of
supporting their leader and strengthening the part of the
order in which he was. For Captain Gassin, personally,
there may have been many excuses; but for the course of
the ship, considered from a military and tactical point of
view, no excuse whatever appears, for she suffered little
in the fight. The void caused by the "Jacobin" was filled
by the ships astern of her pressing up, and this forward
movement, being transmitted to the end of the line, was
partly the cause why the rear British ships did not reach
their numerical opposite in the French order.</p>

<p>Some attention is due to the naval strategy, to the general
conduct and results of this short maritime campaign,
which covered only four weeks,—from the 16th of May,
when Villaret sailed from Brest, to the 11th of June, when
he again anchored just outside the port. In order to form a
just opinion there must be considered the objects of each
party, the forces at their control, and the measures pursued
by them.</p>

<p>The object of the French was to insure the arrival of the
convoy from America. For this purpose they had at sea,
at the first, two detachments,—one of five ships-of-the-line
under Nielly, the other of twenty-five under Villaret.
The rendezvous for the two was the same, and the important
point where their intended junction should take place
was known to their admirals and unknown to the British.
It may be again said that the instructions of the French
government to its officers compelled the latter to avoid, if
possible, any decisive engagement.</p>

<p>The object of the British was twofold: to intercept the
expected convoy, and to bring the French fleet to battle.
The two might, and did, interfere with each other,—might,
by divergence of interest, prompt a separation of the
force. Of the two, fighting the French fleet was indisputably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the more important, and was doubtless so considered
by Howe, in accordance with the usual British naval
policy, which aimed at the destruction of the enemy's
organized force afloat. The ships at his disposal, including
Montagu's squadron, amounted to thirty-two of the
line. He was ignorant of the rendezvous of the French
fleets and of the exact course that would be followed by
the convoy; but of both he could form approximate
estimates.</p>

<p>From the 4th of May, when Montagu's squadron first
separated, until the 19th, Howe supposed the French to be
in Brest. On the latter day his lookouts reconnoitred
the port for the second time, and he then learned that they
had sailed. The same evening he was joined by a frigate
from Montagu, bearing a request for a re-enforcement.
Fearing that his subordinate might fall in with Villaret's
greatly superior force, Howe next morning made all sail
to join him; making a course of west by south, while the
French had been steering west one-half south. On the
21st he fell in with and recaptured a number of Dutch ships,
which had been taken by Villaret on the 19th. From the
logs of these ships, the position and course of the French
fleet two days before was ascertained; and Howe, concluding
that they would not go near Montagu, who was well to
the southward, dismissed the latter from his mind and devoted
himself thenceforth to finding the enemy. This
decision challenges criticism, because Montagu's orders
were, if unsuccessful in finding the convoy, to abandon his
cruise on the 20th and rejoin the admiral off Ushant. If
he complied strictly with these instructions, he should not
now have been very far from the main fleet.</p>

<p>Montagu, however, had seen reason for delaying some
days on his cruising ground, and while thus waiting retook
some of the Dutch prizes taken by Villaret and which had
escaped recapture by Howe on the 21st. He then first
learned of the French sailing, and at the same time that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Howe was in pursuit. Instead of making any attempt to
rejoin his superior, or to take a position where he might
further the general objects of the cruise, he on the 24th or
25th of May bore up for England and anchored at Plymouth
on the 30th. The British naval historian, James,
says this was done in compliance with the spirit of his
orders. It would be more convincing to be told what was
the letter of orders that could admit such a construction,
and what the condition of his ships that could justify forsaking
the field of action with so strong a detachment at
such a critical moment. His decision, on whatever grounds
made, seems not to have met the approval of the government,
and orders were at once sent for him to sail immediately,
accompanied by all the ships-of-the-line ready for
sea at Plymouth. He accordingly did sail on the 4th of
June with nine ships, and on the 8th reached the rendezvous
appointed by Howe off Ushant, which was also the
station indicated by the last instructions of the admiralty
to him. On the 3d of June, the day before he left, the
"Audacious" arrived, bringing the first tidings of the
meeting of the fleets on the 28th of May, in which she
had been disabled.</p>

<p>It appears from this account that neither Howe nor Montagu
attached sufficient importance to the concentration of
the British fleet. Howe's immediate pursuit might indeed
be defended on the ground of the necessity to overtake Villaret,
before he had effected his junction with Nielly; but,
as both these admirals knew their rendezvous, while he did
not, and as Villaret had three days' start, the chances all
were that he would not come up before they met. Actually,
one of Nielly's ships joined before Howe found him,
another on the 29th, and the remainder on the 30th; thus
neutralizing the advantages gained by the fine tactical
efforts of the British admiral on the 28th and 29th. Had
Montagu's six ships, however, come up, the full profit of
the two previous days' fighting would have been preserved;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and it is hard to over-estimate the effect which they would
have had upon the results, even if maintained simply as a
reserve. To these considerations may be added the risk
of missing both fleet and convoy, by going in search of
them, instead of simply taking a position near which they
must pass, and there uniting the British fleet. That this
was very possible is shown by the facts of the chase. "On
the 27th, at 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, having got a few leagues to the northward
of the latitude in which he had reason to think Villaret
was cruising, Lord Howe bore up and ran to the
eastward, with the wind on the starboard quarter."
<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The
fleet had been running on this course, with a fair and apparently
fresh wind for twenty-one hours, when the French
were first seen in the south-south-east. Although no precise
data are at hand, it is reasonable to conclude from the
above that Howe had gone over a hundred miles to the
westward of the French rendezvous, which Villaret had
reached a week before.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> If in the meantime the convoy
had appeared, as it perfectly well might, Villaret would at
once have sailed for Brest, and the British admiral would
not improbably have lost both fleet and convoy.</p>

<p>The question presented is purely strategic. It was certain
that the French fleet, if undisturbed, would meet the
convoy; therefore after it had sailed from Brest the two
objects of the British were merged into one. There was
no occasion thenceforth to remain divided into two detachments.
For what point precisely the convoy would aim
was not known, but Brest and Rochefort marked the two
extreme points of the coast line, between which it would
probably arrive. The approach of so large a body of
ships, tied down to a common movement, is necessarily
slow. It would be as ignorant of the point where the
British would concentrate, as the latter were of the rendezvous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
where the different French detachments were to meet.
Fast single ships, well scattered to the westward, might
reasonably be expected to meet it and to return to their
main body in time to warn this where to look for the prey.
That there were no difficulties in this line of action will
not, certainly, be contended; but it was more sure and
militarily sounder thus to concentrate the British force of
thirty-two ships-of-the-line in a well chosen position, and
with adequate lookouts, than to lead it hither and thither
in search of the enemy's whereabouts. It is a singular and
instructive fact that from first to last not a single British
ship appears to have laid eyes on the convoy from America.
Ships both of commerce and war, belonging to other bodies,
were taken and retaken in the Bay of Biscay; but those
coming from America wore invisible garments.</p>

<p>The strategic aim of the French admiral, after he had
been so unfortunate as to be found by the British fleet,
was to draw it away from the rendezvous appointed for
the convoy. Both his orders and the tactical condition of
his fleet forbade the attempt to secure this by bringing the
enemy to battle. When first met, the French were to
windward, south of the British. If they had been north,
with the same advantage of the wind, the situation would
have been most satisfactory to them; for the convoy was
approaching from the west-south-west, and by retreating
to the northward and westward Villaret would have led
the enemy directly from the position endangering it. As
things were, it was impossible to steer to the northward
without bringing on the battle he had to avoid; and if
defeated where he then was, the victorious fleet would be
left too near the convoy. Villaret, therefore, kept the advantage
of the wind and steered a west course, which diverged
slowly from the convoy's path, and, if long enough
continued, would allow it to pass out of sight. The slowness
of this divergence, however, doubtless contributed to
reconcile him to the loss of the weather gage on the 29th,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and immediately upon finding himself north of the enemy
he went to the northward and westward during the two following
days.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
The result was eminently successful. It is
stated by the latest French authorities
<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> that on the 30th
the convoy passed over the ground where the partial engagement
of the 29th was fought. If so, it must have
been under cover of the dense fog which then prevailed, as
the fleets had not moved very far.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to admire heartily the judicious and
energetic measures by which Howe, on the 28th and 29th
of May, succeeded in gaining the weather gage, while inflicting,
at the same time, a heavy loss upon the enemy.
Whatever judgment may be passed upon his tactics on the
1st of June,—and in the opinion of the writer they were the
best adapted to the situation and to the condition of his
fleet,—it cannot be denied that those of the preceding days
were well conceived, and, on the part of the admiral, vigorously
and gallantly executed. But the strategic mistake,
or misfortune, wherever the fault lay, by which Montagu's
detachment was absent, neutralized the tactical advantage
gained; while the correct strategy of the French, which
brought the two parts of their fleet within supporting
distance of each other, restored the balance of strength.
Thus was again confirmed the maxim of military writers,
that a strategic mistake is more serious and far-reaching
in its effects than an error in tactics.</p>

<p>After the two fleets separated each made the best of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
way to a home port. Lord Howe waited until the morning
of the 3d, securing and refitting his prizes and disabled
ships, and reached Portsmouth on the 13th of June.
Villaret Joyeuse went to Brest. On the morning of the
9th he fell in with Montagu's squadron, a little south of
Ushant. The condition of the French, encumbered with
injured ships, would have afforded an opportunity to a
quick-moving fleet; but two of the British were excessively
slow and the admiral did not dare approach a much
superior force. Villaret pursued for a short distance, but,
fearing to be drawn to leeward of his port in his crippled
state, he soon gave over the chase. On the 11th of June,
all his fleet anchored in Bertheaume roads, outside of
Brest. Montagu, on the 10th, departed for England, a
movement which finally closed the campaign on the part
of the British. On the night of the 12th the French crews
saw a number of lights in the Raz de Sein, the southern
passage by which Brest is approached. They were those
of the long-expected convoy. Admiral Van Stabel, fearing
to find a hostile fleet before the usual and safer entrance,
had steered for the Penmarcks, a rocky promontory thirty
miles south of the port, and thence for the Raz de Sein.
On the same day that Van Stabel made the land Montagu
anchored in Plymouth. Two days later, June 14, the convoy
and the remnant of Villaret's squadron entered Brest
together. Thus ended the cruise, which was marked,
indeed, by a great naval disaster, but had insured the
principal object for which it was undertaken.</p>

</div>

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Year 1794 in the Atlantic and on
  the Continent.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap">WHILE the British ships engaged on the 1st of June
were refitting, Admiral Cornwallis, on the 22d of
the month, sailed in command of Montagu's division for a
cruise to the westward, from which he returned to port on
the 8th of July. With this short exception, both the
Channel and the Bay of Biscay were left unguarded until
the 3d of September, when Howe again sailed with thirty-four
ships-of-the-line, five of which were Portuguese, returning
on the 21st to Torbay after a tempestuous cruise.
The fleet remained in port until November 8, when the
"Canada" seventy-four arrived with the news that her
consort, the "Alexander," of similar force, had been captured
two hundred miles west of Ushant by a French division
of five ships-of-the-line, from which she herself had
escaped by better sailing. The British at once put to sea,
but, it is needless to say, failed to find the French ships,
which had cruised with impunity during their absence;
and on the 29th the fleet anchored again at Spithead, a
station so far to the eastward as to indicate little expectation
of interfering with any of the operations of the enemy
from Brest. There accordingly it remained until the 14th
of the following February. The protection of commerce
was entrusted to squadrons of frigates, whose young and
enterprising commanders did much service by capturing or
dispersing the French forces of a similar character.</p>

<p>The Committee of Public Safety determined to use the
opportunity which was permitted them by the diligent
care of the British admiral to economize his fleet. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
were, at this time, in Brest and the other Biscay ports as
many as forty-six ships-of-the-line, either afloat or building;
whereas in the Mediterranean, in consequence of the disaster
at Toulon, there were only fifteen. The Committee
therefore decided to send six ships round, and Villaret
Joyeuse was directed to sail with the entire Brest fleet,
thirty-five in all, for the purpose of escorting this division
clear of the Bay of Biscay; after which he was to cruise
for a fortnight against British commerce. The destitution
of the Brest arsenal, however, still continued; for, with
the enemy's command of the Channel, the naval stores of
the Baltic could reach Brest only by going north of the
British islands, and then running the risk of capture in
the Atlantic by hostile cruisers. There had therefore been
great difficulty in repairing the injuries received in the actions
with Lord Howe, as well as in equipping the ships
not then engaged. When the orders were received, vivid
remonstrances were made, and the condition of the vessels
fully represented to the Committee as being entirely unfit
for a winter's cruise. Many masts wounded in the battle
could not be replaced, the rigging was in bad condition,
the crews were untrained. Several of the ships it was
proposed to send were old and worn out; and so great
was the dearth of provisions that only those for Toulon
received enough for some months, the others for no more
than four weeks.</p>

<p>Robespierre had fallen five months before, and the
Reign of Terror was now over; but the Committee were
still unaccustomed to admit objections, and did not find in
their limited knowledge of sea matters any reason for recalling
orders once given. On the 24th of December,
1794, the fleet began to leave Brest, and, in so doing, one
of the largest, of one hundred and ten guns, was wrecked
on a rock in the entrance. On the 29th the remaining
thirty-four had cleared the harbor and anchored in the
road outside, whence they sailed on the 30th. On the night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of January 1, 1795, a furious gale sprang up, followed
by a spell of violent weather. Two eighty-gun ships and
a seventy-four foundered, the crews being with difficulty
saved. Two yet larger, of one hundred and ten guns, had
seven feet of water in the hold and would have been lost
had the storm lasted for twenty-four hours longer. Another
seventy-four had to be run on the coast to save the
lives of her people. In the midst of these difficulties, which
caused the separation of the fleet, it was necessary to transfer
provisions from the Toulon division to the other ships,
an herculean undertaking, but imperative to keep the latter
from starving. On the 2d of February the greater
part of the survivors again reached Brest; but some had
to scatter to other ports as the weather permitted. The
Toulon ships returned with the rest. This mid-winter
cruise had cost the republic five ships-of-the-line; it
brought in one British corvette and seventy merchantmen
as prizes.</p>

<p>The stars, or rather the winds, in their courses had
fought for Great Britain; but in no wise did she owe anything
to her own efforts. Not till the 14th of February
did the Channel fleet put to sea, nearly a fortnight after
the French had returned to Brest. Whatever may be said
of the inexpediency of exposing the heavy ships to winter
weather, it seems clear that the opposite system left the
enemy at perfect liberty to combine his movements; and
that there was little likelihood of these being made known
to the commander-in-chief in Torbay soon enough for him
to follow efficaciously. Howe himself felt this, and, from
instructions issued by him to Sir James Saumarez on the
15th of January, it would appear that this escape of the
French roused him for a moment to contemplate the close
watch off Brest, afterwards practised by Jervis and Cornwallis.
<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
This was the last occasion on which the veteran
admiral actually went to sea in command of a fleet; although,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
from an apparent reluctance to try new men, the
government insisted upon his exercising a nominal charge
from quarters on shore. He was now in his seventieth
year and suffering from many infirmities. The command
afloat devolved upon a man not much younger, Lord Bridport,
one of the naval family of Hood, but whose career
does not bear the impress of great ability which distinguished
so many of its members. Immediately before this,
general dissatisfaction had caused a change in the Admiralty,
over which, since 1788, had presided Pitt's elder
brother, the Earl of Chatham. He was succeeded, in
December, 1794, by Earl Spencer, a more vigorous and
efficient man, who remained First Lord until the fall of
Pitt's administration in 1801.</p>

<p>The new head, however, did not make any substantial
variation of system, calculated to frustrate the enemy's
naval combinations by the strategic dispositions of the British
fleet. More activity was displayed by keeping a small
squadron of half a dozen ships-of-the-line constantly cruising
in the soundings and to the westward, and the great
Channel fleet was more continuously at sea during the
summer months; but the close blockade of Brest was not
attempted, nor was Bridport the man to persuade the government
to the measures afterwards so vigorously, and in
the main successfully, carried out by Lord St. Vincent,
both as successor to Bridport in the Channel fleet and subsequently
as First Lord of the Admiralty. To this faulty
policy contributed not a little the system of telegraphs,
adopted in 1795, by which communications were quickly
transmitted from height to height between London and
Portsmouth. This great improvement unfortunately confirmed
the tendency of the Admiralty to keep the Channel
fleet at the latter point, regardless of the obvious, but unappreciated,
strategic disadvantage of a position so far
east of Brest, with winds prevailing from the western quarters.
To have the commander-in-chief just there, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
their own hand, to receive orders from them, seemed much
safer than to put him and his fleet in a central position
whence he could most certainly intercept or most rapidly
follow the enemy, and then to trust to the judgment of a
trained and competent sea-officer to act as the emergency
required. The plan came near resulting very disastrously
when the French attempted to invade Ireland; and would
have done so, had not the elements again interfered to
remedy the absence of the British fleet. "If," says Osler
in his life of Lord Exmouth,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> from whom he probably received
the idea, "if Lord Bridport (in 1796) had been
waiting at Falmouth, with discretional powers, Sir Edward
Pellew having been instructed to communicate directly
with him, he might have sailed early on December 21st"
(Pellew reached Falmouth from before Brest on the 20th)
"and found the enemy in Bantry Bay, when perhaps not a
ship would have escaped him. It is, however, to be remembered
that, as the destination of the French armament
was unknown to the last, the Admiralty might very
properly determine that he should receive his final instructions
from themselves, and therefore would keep the fleet
at Spithead (Portsmouth) for the convenience of ready
communication." But why! How could they in London
judge better than a good admiral on the coast?</p>

<p>During the year 1794, now closing, the Revolution in
France had been rapidly devouring its children. After the
overthrow of the Girondists in June, 1793, the Terror
pursued its pitiless march, sweeping before it for the time
every effort made in behalf of moderation or mercy.
The queen was put to death on the 16th of October, and
her execution was followed on the 31st by that of those
Girondists who had not deigned to escape from their
accusers. Dissension next arose and spread among the
now triumphant party of the Jacobins; resulting in March
and April, 1794, in the trial and death of the Hébertists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
on the one side, and of Danton and his friends on the
other. More and more power fell into the hands of the
Committee of Public Safety, whose tokens to the world
were Robespierre and his chief supporters, St. Just and
Couthon, ruling the Convention which passively decreed
their wishes, and, through the Convention, France. For
three short months Robespierre now appeared as the
master of the country, but was himself carried on and
away by the torrent which he had done so much to swell.
The exigencies and dangers of his position multiplied the
precautions he deemed necessary to secure his authority
and his safety; and the cold relentlessness of his character
recognized no means so sure as death. On the
10th of June, by his sole authority, without the intervention
of the Committee of Public Safety, he procured a
decree modifying the procedure of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, and suppressing the few checks that restrained
its uncontrolled power. In the fourteen months preceding
this decree 1256 persons had been by the tribunal condemned
to death; in the six weeks that followed, until
Robespierre himself fell, the executions were 1361.
<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> So
extreme an access of fury betokened approaching exhaustion;
no society could endure the strain; the most
violent and blood-thirsty, as well as the most timid, felt
their own lives in danger. Bitter opposition to the dictator
arose both in the Committee of Public Safety and
in the Legislature. The doubtful struggle, between the
prestige of his power and long continued success and
the various passions of fear and vengeance animating his
opponents, culminated in a violent scene in the Convention
on the 27th of July. For some hours the issue
was balanced, but in the end the arrest and trial of
Robespierre and his chief supporters were decreed. The
following day he, St. Just and Couthon, with some others
of lesser note, died on the guillotine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>No immediate change in the form of government ensued.
The Committee of Public Safety, reconstituted, continued
to exercise the executive functions which nominally depended
upon the Convention; and the impulse which it
had imparted to the soldiers and armies of France continued
for a time to carry them resistlessly forward. But
the delirious intensity of the popular movement had
reached its climax in the three months' unrestrained power
of Robespierre, with whose name it has been ever associated.
Though the external manifestations of strength
continued for a time unabated, the inner tension was relaxing.
Weakness was about to succeed the strength of
fever, to spread from the heart throughout the whole organism,
and, by threatening social dissolution, to prepare
the way for concentrated absolute power.</p>

<p>The onward swing of the French armies on the north-east
still continued. The year 1794 had opened with the
investment of Landrecy by the allies, and its surrender to
them on the 30th of April. The French began their campaign
with the plan, especially affected by Carnot in all his
military combinations, of attacking at the same time both
flanks of the allied Austrians, Dutch and English, concentrating
at each extremity of the line a force greatly
superior to the enemy before it. As Jourdan, commanding
the French right, threatened the allied stronghold
of Charleroi, he drew thither the greater effort of the
allies, and Pichegru, on the left, found his task easier.
Five times did Jourdan cross the Sambre to attack Charleroi,
and four times was he compelled to re-cross; but on
the fifth, before the allies could come up in sufficient force,
the place capitulated,—the guns of the relieving force
being heard just as the garrison was marching out.
The following day, June 26, 1794, Jourdan fought and
won the battle of Fleurus; the Austrians retreating upon
Nivelles towards the future field of Waterloo. The
allies on both flanks continued to fall back; Ostend and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Nieuport, ports on the North Sea facilitating communication
with England, were successively surrendered, and
Brussels uncovered. On the 10th of July Pichegru entered
Brussels and formed his junction with Jourdan.
On the 15th the allies lost Landrecy, the first and only
prize of the campaign. On the same day the French attacked
in force the centre of the allied line, where the
Anglo-Dutch left touched the Austrian right. The former
being gradually turned fell back, and the Austrians, finding
their flank uncovered, did the same. From this time
the allies retired in divergent directions, the Anglo-Dutch
north-east toward Holland, the Austrians eastward toward
Coblentz; thus repeating in retreat the unmilitary and
ruinous mistake which had rendered abortive the
offensive campaign of 1793.</p>

<p>The French advance was now stayed by the Committee
of Public Safety, in deference to an emotion of patriotism,
until the towns surrendered the year before should be
retaken. On the 11th of August Le Quesnoy opened its
gates, on the 27th Valenciennes, and on the 30th Condé.
The siege corps now rejoined the armies in the field and
the advance was resumed; Pichegru following the British
and Dutch toward Holland, Jourdan, by a series of flank
attacks which threatened the communications of the Austrians,
forcing the latter from one position to another, until
on the 5th October they recrossed to the east side of the
Rhine, the French occupying Coblentz and Bonn on the
west bank. The advance of Pichegru was marked by less
of battle and more of siege than that of Jourdan, but was
alike successful. By the middle of October his army had
reached the Rhine; which in Holland divides into two
branches, the Waal and the Leek, between which the
enemy lay. A month later they had retreated beyond the
latter, the French being for a moment stopped by the floating
ice in the rivers; but the winter was one of unusual
severity, and early in January the waters were frozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
hard. On the 17th of January, 1795, the Prince of
Orange left Holland for England, and on the 20th
Pichegru entered Amsterdam. The provinces and cities
everywhere declared for the French, and a provisional republican
government was established; while the pursuit
of the British troops was continued with unremitting diligence
until they had escaped into German territory,
whence they returned, in April, to England.</p>

<p>The occupation of Belgium and Holland by the French
was in every way a matter of concern to the other European
powers. It threatened Great Britain in the North
Sea, where her flank had previously been strengthened by
the Dutch alliance, and compelled her at once to weaken
the Channel fleet by a detachment of five ships-of-the-line
to confront the Dutch squadrons. The merchants of
Holland being among the great money-lenders of Europe,
large revenues were opened to the needy French; and the
resources thus gained by them were by the same blow lost
to the allies. Great Britain thenceforth had to bear alone
the money burden of the war. But on the other hand
the republican commissaries sucked like leeches the substance
of the Dutch; and the sources of their wealth,
commerce and the colonies, were at the same time threatened
with extinction by the British sea power, whose
immediate hostility was incurred by the change in their
political relations. Within a month, on the 9th of February,
orders were issued to arrest all Dutch ships at sea;
temporary provision being made to restore neutral property
found on board them, because shipped while Holland was
an ally. Vigorous measures were at once taken for the
seizure of the rich Dutch colonies in all parts of the
world; and before the year 1795 closed, there passed
into the hands of Great Britain the Cape of Good
Hope, Malacca, all the Dutch possessions on the continent
of India, and the most important places in Ceylon; the
whole island submitting in 1796. Besides these, other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
colonies were taken in the farther East and in the West
Indies. The Dutch navy remained inoffensively in its
ports until the year 1797, with the exception of a small
expedition that escaped from the Texel in February, 1796,
prepared to retake the Cape of Good Hope. Unable to go
through the English Channel, which was completely under
the enemy's control, it passed north of the British Islands
and eluded capture until Saldanha Bay, near the Cape, was
reached. Upon hearing of its arrival the British admiral
on that station sailed in pursuit, and, having a greatly
superior force, received its instant surrender.</p>

<p>The success that followed the French standards in Belgium
and Holland during 1794 accompanied the less
striking operations on the Rhine and in the South. At the
end of the year the Austrians and Prussians had abandoned
the west bank of the river, except Luxembourg and the
very important fortress of Mayence. Luxembourg also
was closely invested, and capitulated in June, 1795. In
the Pyrenees, the Spaniards were driven across the frontiers,
and had, in the early autumn, established themselves
in a strong entrenched camp at Figueras. On the 17th
and 20th of November the French assaulted this position,
and on the latter day drove the enemy from all their works
round the place, forcing them to retreat upon Gerona. The
garrison of Figueras, ten thousand strong, capitulated a
week later, and the French then invested Rosas, which held
out for two months longer; but the resistance of Spain was
completely broken, and the further events of the war in
that quarter are unimportant.</p>

<p>On the Italian frontier the year opened with substantial
successes on the part of the French, who got possession of
important mountain passes of the Alps; but progress here
was stopped, in May, by reverses attending the operations
on the Rhine, causing troops to be withdrawn from the
Army of the Alps. The belligerents rested in the same
relative positions during the remainder of 1794.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>The important political results of the French military
successes in the campaign of 1794 were demonstrated and
sealed by treaties of peace contracted in 1795 with Prussia,
Spain, and Holland. That with the latter power was one not
only of peace, but also of alliance, offensive and defensive.
The principal naval conditions were that the United Provinces
should furnish twelve ships-of-the-line, with frigates,
to cruise in the North Sea and Baltic, and should admit a
French garrison into the important seaport of Flushing.
This treaty was signed May 15, 1795. The Prussian treaty
was concluded on the 5th of April. It stipulated, generally,
the surrender of Prussian possessions on the left
bank of the Rhine, and by a later agreement established a
neutral zone in North Germany under Prussian guarantee.
The treaty with Spain was signed at Basle on the 22d of
July. It maintained the integrity of the Spanish possessions
in Europe, but provided for the cession to France of
Spain's part of Haïti.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Great Britain during the same year
drew closer the ties binding her to her still remaining
allies. An agreement was made in May with the emperor
of Germany that he should provide not less than two hundred
thousand men for the approaching campaign, while
Great Britain was to pay a large subsidy for their support.
This was followed by a treaty of defensive alliance, each
government engaging not to make a separate peace. With
Russia also was made a defensive alliance, and the czarina
sent twelve ships-of-the-line to cruise with the British fleet
in the North Sea.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE year 1795 was for France one of reaction and lassitude.
The wave of popular ferment which had
been rushing forward since the fall of the royalty, gathering
strength and volume, and driving before it all wills and all
ambitions, crested and broke in July, 1794. Like the
breakers of the seashore, a part of the accumulated momentum
was expended in a tumultuous momentary advance,
of increased force but diminishing depth, and then
recession followed. The forward and backward impulses
met and mingled, causing turmoil and perplexing currents
of popular feeling, but the pure republican movement
had reached the highest point it was destined to attain.
It had stirred France to its depths, and brought to
the surface many a gem which under quieter conditions
would have remained hidden from the eyes of men; but, in
the confusion and paralysis which followed, these were left
stranded and scattered, waiting for the master hand which
should combine them and set each in its proper sphere
for the glory of France.</p>

<p>The recoil which followed the death of Robespierre took
shape in several ways, all tending at once to lessen the internal
vigor of the government, and to deprive it of means
hitherto possessed for external effort. The revulsion to
mercy provoked by his bloody tyranny was accompanied by
sentiments of vengeance against the men who were, or
were supposed to be, identified with his policy. The indulgence
extended to those before proscribed brought them
back to France in numbers, clamorous for revenge. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
discordant sentiments, agitating the Convention as well as
the people, the provinces as well as Paris, shattered that
unity of purpose which had been the strength of the government
after the fall of the Girondists, and during the
domination of the Jacobins. At the same time were revoked
the measures by which the Revolutionary Government,
living as it did from hand to mouth, had provided
for its immense daily necessities. The law of the Maximum,
by which dealers were forbidden to charge beyond a
certain fixed price for the prime necessaries of life, was repealed.
The paper money, already depreciated, fell rapidly,
now that the seller could demand as much as he wished
for articles of universal consumption. The government,
obliged to receive the assignats at their face value in payment
of dues, sought to meet its difficulty by increased
issues, which accelerated the decline. At the same time,
requisitions in kind having been suppressed, as part of the
reaction from a rule of force, supplies of all sorts were with
difficulty obtained. Distress, lack of confidence, abounded
in all directions; speculation ran riot, and the government,
having relaxed the spring of terror, that most powerful of motives
until it becomes unendurable, found itself drifting into
impotence. These various measures were not completed
till near the end of 1794; and the evil effect was, therefore,
not immediately felt in the armies,—whose wants were
also in part supplied by liberal demands upon their new
allies in Holland. Boissi d'Anglas, in a speech made January
30, 1795, in the Convention, and adopted by that body
as voicing its own sentiments, declared that the armies
would demonstrate to Europe that, far from being exhausted
by the three years of war, France had only augmented
her resources. The year then opening was to
witness to the emptiness of the boast, until Bonaparte by
his military genius laid the Continent again at her feet.</p>

<p>The internal history of France during this year, though
marked by many and important events, can be briefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
summed up. The policy of reconciliation towards the
classes who had most suffered under Jacobin rule was
pursued by the government; but against the party lately
dominant the reaction that set in was marked by many
and bloody excesses. If in the North and West the insurgent
Vendeans and Chouans accepted the proffered pardon
of the Convention, in the South and East the reactionary
movement produced a terror of its own; in which perished,
by public massacre or private assassination, several
thousand persons, many of whom had not been terrorists,
but simply ardent republicans. In Paris, the Jacobins,
though depressed and weakened by the loss of so many of
their leaders, did not at once succumb; and the tendency
to agitation was favored in that great centre by the poverty
of the people and the scarcity of food. On the 1st of
April, and again on the 20th of May, the halls of the Convention
were invaded by crowds of men, women and children,
demanding bread and the constitution of 1793. On
the latter occasion a member of the Convention was shot
while endeavoring to cover the president with his body, and
the greater part of the deputies fled from the hall. Those
who remained, belonging mostly to the old Mountain,
voted certain propositions designed to calm the people;
but the next day the crowd was driven out by the national
guard from some sections of the city, and the reaction resumed
its course with increased force and renewed thirst
for vengeance. The deputies who had remained and voted
the propositions of May 20 were impeached, and the arrest
was ordered of all members of the Committees which had
governed during the Terror, except Carnot and one other.</p>

<p>The following month, June, the project for a new constitution
was submitted to the Convention, and by it
adopted on the 22d of August. It provided for an Executive
Directory of five members, and a Legislature of two
Chambers; the upper to be called the Council of the Elders,
the lower the Council of Five Hundred. To this scheme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of a constitution, the Convention appended a decree that
two thirds of the new Legislature must be taken from the
members of the existing Convention. The Constitution
and the decree were submitted to the country in September.
The Provinces accepted both, but Paris rejected the decree;
and the protest against the latter took form on the 4th
of October in the revolt of the Sections,—a movement of
the bourgeoisie and reactionists against the Convention,
which on this occasion fell back for support upon the party
identified with the Jacobins. The defence of the Hall of
Legislature and of its members was entrusted to Barras,
who committed the military command to General Bonaparte,
from whose skilful dispositions the assault of the
Sections everywhere recoiled. On the 26th of October the
National Convention dissolved, after an existence of three
years and one month. On the 27th the new Legislature began
its sittings; and the upper council at once elected the
Executive Directory. Among its five members was Carnot.</p>

<p>On the sea the year 1795 was devoid of great or even
striking events. On the 22d of February the six ships destined
for Toulon, which had been driven back early in the
month with the rest of the Brest fleet, again set sail under
the command of Admiral Renaudin, and, although much
delayed by heavy westerly winds in the Atlantic, reached
their destination in safety early in April. Not an enemy's
ship was seen on the way. The Channel fleet had gone
back to Spithead as soon as Howe learned that the Brest
fleet had returned to port after the disastrous January
cruise; while in the Mediterranean the British, now under
Admiral Hotham, were at anchor in a roadstead of Corsica
when Renaudin drew near Toulon. This made the
French in the Mediterranean twenty to the British thirteen.
"What the new Lords of the Admiralty are after,"
wrote Nelson, "to allow such a detachment to get out
here, surprises us all."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the new admiralty small divisions of the Channel
fleet continued to cruise to the westward or in the Bay of
Biscay; but not until the 12th of June did the main body,
under Lord Bridport, put to sea. Ten days later, numbering
then fourteen sail-of-the-line, it fell in with Villaret's
fleet of twelve ships close in with its own coast,
about eighty miles south of Brest. This meeting was due
to a succession of incidents which are worthy of narration,
as showing the conditions of the war and the prostration
of the French navy. The supplies of the squadron at
Brest and L'Orient, as well as much of the local traffic of
the country, were carried by small coasting vessels rather
than by inland roads. A division of three ships-of-the-line
was sent to protect a numerous convoy coming from Bordeaux.
On the 8th of June these vessels encountered the
British division of five ships cruising in the Bay of Biscay,
which took from it eight of the convoy before they could
escape under the land. When news of this reached Brest,
Villaret was ordered to take the nine ships that alone were
then ready for sea and join the other three. This junction
was made, and on the 16th of June the twelve again fell in
with the British five, which, after temporarily withdrawing,
had returned to their cruising ground. Chase was of
course given, and as two of the British sailed very badly
there was a good prospect that either they would be taken,
or the rest of the division compelled to come down to their
aid; which, with the disparity of force, ought to result in
the capture of the whole. The admiral, Cornwallis, behaved
with the utmost firmness and coolness; but with
such odds and the disadvantage of speed, no courage nor
conduct can avert some disaster. The inefficiency and bad
gunnery of the French saved their enemies. After a
cannonade which lasted from nine in the forenoon of the
17th until six in the evening, one British ship had thirteen
men wounded, and Villaret abandoned the pursuit.</p>

<p>Five days later Bridport's fleet was sighted, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
French being inferior stood in for their coast, intending to
anchor and await action under the island called Groix.
The pursuit continued with light airs all day and night;
but at daybreak of June 23 the fastest British were within
three miles of the slowest of the French, which opened fire
at six <span class="sc">A.M.</span> All Villaret's signals could not bring his fleet
into line, nor induce the undoubtedly brave, but ill trained,
men who commanded the faster ships to take station for
the support of the slower. A desultory action continued
till half-past eight, ending in the capture of three French
vessels, the last hauling down her flag within a mile of Île
Groix. Bridport then called his ships off. It is the opinion
of French writers, apparently shared by English critics,
<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
that if he had pursued energetically, the remainder of the
enemy must either have been taken or run ashore to avoid
that fate. As it was, Villaret was permitted to get into
L'Orient without molestation, although to do so he had to
wait till the tide served. Such was the extreme circumspection
characterizing the early naval operations of the
British, until Jervis and Nelson enkindled their service
with the relentless energy of spirit inspired by Bonaparte
on land. Those to whom St. Vincent and the Nile, Algesiras
and Copenhagen, have become history, see with astonishment
nine ships of capital importance permitted to
escape thus easily from fourteen; forgetting the hold tradition
has on the minds of men, and that it belongs to genius
to open the way into which others then eagerly press. How
the admiralty viewed Bridport's action may be inferred
from his retaining command of the fleet until April, 1800.
The ships that reached L'Orient had to remain till the winter,
when they slipped back two or three at a time to Brest.</p>

<p>The disaster at Île Groix, with some similar small misfortunes
in the Mediterranean,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> accompanied as they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
by evidences, too plain to be any longer overlooked, of the
inefficiency both of officers and men in the French fleets,
determined the government to abandon all attempt to contest
the supremacy of the sea. To this contributed also
the extreme destitution, in the dockyards, of all sorts of
stores for equipment or provision. With the English
Channel and the forests of Corsica in the hands of Great
Britain, the customary sources of supply were cut off; and
moreover the providing for the navy—not the most cherished
of the national institutions—met with the same difficulty
as was experienced by other branches of the public
service in the depreciation of the assignats, with which
alone naval administrators could pay contractors. At the
end of 1795 twelve hundred francs in paper were worth
scarce twenty in gold. Having accepted naval inferiority
as a necessary condition, the Committee of Public Safety
resolved to maintain the great fleets in the ports simply as
a threat to the enemy, and to send to sea only small divisions
to prey upon his commerce and to levy tribute upon
his colonies.</p>

<p>From the end of 1795 forward, this policy prevailed and
was finally accepted even by the emperor after several
attempts, fruitless through the incompetence of his sea-officers,
to realize on the sea that employment of great
masses in which he so wonderfully excelled on land. The
reluctance of his supreme genius to accede to this system
of petty war may be accepted as testimony that on sea, as
on shore, great results can only be expected by wielding
great masses. Upon this conclusion history too has set
its seal; for the squadron and division warfare of the
French navy, seconded though it was by hosts of commerce-destroyers,
public and private, produced practically no results,
had absolutely no effect upon the issue of the war.
On the other hand, that Napoleon, when convinced that he
could expect nothing decisive from his fleet, accepted the
use of it as a means of harassment or of diversion, must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
be received as a weighty indication of the naval policy
suited to the inferior power. To assume a menacing attitude
at many points, to give effect to the menace by frequent
and vigorous sorties, to provoke thus a dispersion of
the enemy's superior force, that he may be led to expose
detachments to attack by greater numbers,—such must be
the outline of conduct laid down for the weaker navy. But
that such a course may be really effective,—that the inferior
may, as in some of Bonaparte's wonderful campaigns,
become ultimately superior,—there must be at some fitly
chosen point of the sea frontier a concentrated body of
ships; whose escape, if effected, may be the means of inflicting
a great disaster upon the enemy by crushing one or
more of the exposed fractions of his fleet. Unless there be
such a central mass, mere dissemination is purposeless.
Inferiority carried beyond a certain degree becomes impotence;
nor will all the commerce-destroyers fancy can picture
restore the balance to the nation hopelessly weaker in
ships of the line-of-battle.</p>

<p>On land as well as on sea weakness was stamped on the
military movements of the year 1795. Its diplomatic successes
were due to the arms of 1794. Early in the year
Pichegru was removed from Holland to the upper Rhine,
being succeeded by Moreau. Between the armies commanded
by these two lay that of the Sambre and Meuse,
still under Jourdan, concentrated on the left bank of the
Rhine between Dusseldorf and Coblentz. It was provided
that, in case of the three armies acting together, the chief
command should be with Pichegru. The removal of the
restraint enforced by the Terror was evidenced in these
Northern forces by the number of desertions during the
severity of this unusual winter. In the army of Italy the
case was even worse; and the frightful destitution of
the soldiers, made known a year later in Bonaparte's celebrated
proclamation upon taking command, led to even
greater losses from the ranks. Toward the end of January
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
seventeen thousand men were detached from this army
to Toulon to take part in a projected invasion of Corsica.
The expedition never sailed; but such was the horror inspired
by the sufferings they had undergone that the hardiest
soldiers forsook their colors, and of two fine divisions
not ten thousand men rejoined the army.
<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Under such conditions military operations could not but
be sluggish; the genius of a Bonaparte was needed to supply
the impetus which the emasculated central government
could no longer impart. The great Carnot, also, had been
removed from the direction of the war, March 4, 1795,
under the law prescribing periodic changes of members in
the Committee of Public Safety. The fall of Luxembourg,
already mentioned, was obtained only by the slow process
of blockade. Not till September, when the season was
nearly over, did the French armies move; Jourdan and
Pichegru being then directed to undertake a concerted invasion,
from their widely separated positions, intending to
form a junction in the enemy's country. Jourdan crossed
the Rhine, advanced south as far as the Main, and invested
Mayence, the Austrians retiring before him. Pichegru received
the capitulation of Mannheim, which opened its
gates upon the threat of bombardment without receiving a
shot. He showed no vigor in following this success, and
his dilatory ill-combined movements permitted the Austrian
general, Clairfayt, to concentrate his armies in a central
position between the Main and Mannheim, parting the two
French leaders. The new direction of war, either through
folly, or from sharing the growing inefficiency of the general
government, had failed to accumulate the supplies of
all kinds needed by the masses thus gathered in a wild and
impoverished region. Clairfayt combined a powerful movement
against the destitute and suffering army of Jourdan,
compelling him to retreat and recross the Rhine. Leaving
a corps of observation before him and holding Pichegru in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
check on the south, he then himself crossed the river at
Mayence and assaulted vigorously the lines on the left
bank with which the enemy during the past year had surrounded
the place. The blockading forces were driven
back in divergent directions; and the Austrians in increasing
numbers poured into the country west of the river, separating
Jourdan from Pichegru.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the National Convention was
dissolving and the Directory assuming the reins of government.
Carnot became one of its five members. Impressed
by the importance of retaining Mannheim, the loss of which
was threatened by the recent reverses, he sent urgent orders
to Jourdan to move south to the support of his colleague,
using his own judgment as to the means. It was
too late. The mingled weakness and ignorance of the preceding
government had caused a destitution of means and
an inferiority of force wholly inadequate to cope with the
superior strategic position of the Austrian masses. Mannheim,
which had surrendered on the 20th of September,
was regained on the 22d of November by the Austrians,
who at once re-enforced the troops on the west bank, acting
against Pichegru, while Clairfayt pushed further back the
other French army. With this success his brilliant operations
closed for the year. The weather had become excessively
bad, causing great sickness; and on the 19th of December
he proposed an armistice, which Jourdan was only
too glad to accept. The Austrians, who when the year
opened were east of the Rhine, remained in force on the
west bank, holding well-advanced positions based upon
Mayence and Mannheim,—the two capital places for
sustaining operations on either side of the river.</p>

<p>The suspension of arms lasted until May 30, 1796, when
the French, having given the notification required by the
terms of the armistice, again crossed the river and began
hostilities. But, although great and instructive military
events followed this new undertaking, the centre of interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
had by this time shifted from the north and east to the
Italian frontier of the republic, where the successes of
Bonaparte enchained it until the Peace of Campo Formio
dissolved the coalition against France. That dazzling career
had begun which becomes, thenceforth until its close,
the main thread of French history, to which other incidents
have to be referred, and by following which their mutual
relations are most easily understood. We have reached
therefore the period when a naval narrative reverts naturally
to the Mediterranean; for Bonaparte's Italian campaigns
profoundly affected the political and maritime
conditions in that sea. Upon it also he next embarked for
the extraordinary enterprise, condemned by many as chimerical,
and yet so signally stamped by the characteristics
of his genius, in which he first came into collision with the
Sea Power of Great Britain, destined to ruin his career,
and with the great seaman in whom that Sea Power found
the highest expression it has ever attained.</p>

<p>"During the year 1795," says the distinguished military
historian of these wars, "France, after a twelvemonth of
victory, came near losing all her conquests; threatened
with a dangerous internal reaction, she only with difficulty
succeeded in freeing herself from embarrassments and
modifying the defects of her institutions. The next year
we shall find her launched in a yet vaster career, by the
great captain who so long presided over her destinies,
who raised her to the pinnacle of glory by his victories,
and thence plunged her to the abyss through disregard of
justice and moderation."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a>

<p class="chapsum"><span class="sc">The Mediterranean and Italy.—From the Evacuation of
Toulon in 1793 to the British Withdrawal from that
Sea, in 1796, and the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, February,
1797.—Austria Forced to Make Peace.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap">AFTER the evacuation of Toulon, on the 19th of December,
1793, Lord Hood had taken his fleet to Hyères
Roads,—an anchorage formed by the group of islands of the
same name a few miles east of Toulon. There he remained
during the greater part of January, revictualling
his ships and considering what steps should next be taken
to assure British interests in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>It is essential to a fleet, as to an army, to have always
near at hand depots of supplies, upon which it can depend
to replace the consumption of the limited stores carried on
board, and to which it can resort for refit. The way from
the depots to the fleet, or the army, technically called the
communications, should be such as can most easily be defended
by the armed force itself, without impairing its liberty
in movements necessary to obtain the objects of the war.
In other words, this depot, or base, should be near the
scene of operations and, when practicable, so situated that
the fleet, while actively engaged, interposes directly or indirectly
between it and the enemy. Nearness was doubly
important in the days of sailing ships, whose movements
depended upon the fickle element of the wind; for then a
ship going in for refit not only took more time to perform the
voyage, but also in returning made a heavier draft upon her
resources, and consequently could remain a shorter period
at the seat of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Toulon, while securely held, served as such a base; although,
being exposed to overpowering attack from the
land side, its situation called for excessive expenditure of
effort. Toulon was, however, now lost, and the British were
thrown back upon Gibraltar, at the very entrance of the
Mediterranean, and nine hundred miles from the seat of
hostilities, for a secure depot in which to land stores and a
safe anchorage for transports and crippled ships-of-war.</p>

<p>Although the possession of a strong place, suited in
itself for a base, may decide the character of operations
projected, logically the necessary operations should first be
determined, and the choice of the base be decided by them.
In the Mediterranean, as elsewhere generally at this time,
the policy of Great Britain was to control the sea for the
protection of commerce, and to sustain on shore the continental
powers in the war against France,—chiefly by
money, but also by naval co-operation when feasible.
To support the land warfare, her diplomatic negotiations
strove to unite, in the general military effort, as many
as possible of the small independent states into which
Italy was divided, to promote among them unity of
action, and to foster the sense of security, in taking a
decided step against France, which they could only derive
from the presence among them of a strong power, such as
Great Britain showed in her fleet. Neither their traditions
nor the character of their rulers enabled them to combine
strongly as equals; nor, as has before been said, was there
any one state so predominant as to give a nucleus around
which the others could gather. The only possible centre
was Great Britain, present as a power in her fleet. Moreover,
if unable, as she proved, to stir them up to positive,
harmonious, concerted action, it was her interest to impose
upon them a benevolent neutrality towards herself and
her allies, and to deter them from inimical measures into
which they might otherwise be impelled by the demands of
the republic and their fear of the French army. Friendly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
ports along the whole coast were essential for the security
of her shipping and the promotion of her commerce.
Finally, it must be added that the character of the shore
between Nice and Genoa, interposing between the French
and Austrian armies, particularly favored direct naval co-operation.
The Maritime Alps and the Apennines, coming
down close to the sea, left but a single narrow, and yet
long, line of communications along the beach, traversed
by a very bad road, in many parts under fire from the sea.
<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
This condition made the armies using that line chiefly
dependent for supplies upon coasters, whose movements
ships-of-war could harass and impede,—though not, when
sailing vessels, entirely stop.</p>

<p>Corsica, in its existing political conditions of revolt
against France under the leadership of Paoli, appeared to
offer the strategic situation which Hood was seeking.
It was near and centrally placed with reference to the
probable operations on shore; San Fiorenzo Bay, which
became the chief anchorage for the fleet, being equidistant,
about one hundred miles, from Nice and from Genoa.
Leghorn also, one of the greatest depots of British trade
in the Mediterranean and the seaport of Tuscany, over
which Great Britain wished to enforce her influence, was
but sixty miles from Cape Corso at the northern extremity
of the island. All the trade with northern Italy had to
pass close to Corsica, and was consequently exposed to
capture if the seaports remained in French hands; especially
as calms prevail around the island, facilitating the
operations of row-galleys and neutralizing the powers of a
sailing navy. Being an island, Corsica depended upon
the control of the sea; and, though its size and rugged
surface precluded conquest, there was believed to be a
disposition to accept the protection of Great Britain as
the only means of dispossessing the French troops, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
still held the seaports of San Fiorenzo, Bastia, and
Calvi.</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert Elliott, who had been the Civil Commissioner
of Great Britain in Toulon during the last month of its
occupation, left Hyères Bay early in January to confer
with Paoli, who had proposed the annexation of the
island to the British crown. His enthusiastic reception by
the people and the assurances of the Corsican chieftain
convinced him that the measure was sincerely desired; and
in consequence of his representations, Hood, on the 24th
of January, sailed from Hyères with his whole fleet for San
Fiorenzo Bay. The weather proving very tempestuous,
and the three-decked ships, of which there were several,
being ill-fitted to contend with it, the admiral was forced
to take them to Porto Ferrajo in Elba, and to send against
San Fiorenzo a detachment only. This appeared off the
place on the 7th of February; and after a series of combined
operations, in which the navy bore a very conspicuous
share on land, the French evacuated the town and
works on the 19th of the month, retreating upon Bastia.
The admiral then urged an attack upon Bastia; but the
general thought he could not spare enough men. Nelson,
who had been blockading there for some time, strongly
represented the feasibility of the enterprise; and, after a
sharp altercation between the two commanders-in-chief,
Hood determined to undertake the siege with the navy and
the troops who were serving on board as marines. The
landing began on the 3d of April; but the place held out
till the 21st of May, when it capitulated. Calvi was next
taken in hand, the operations beginning on the 19th of
June, and ending with its surrender on the 10th of
August. The whole island was thus freed from the
presence of French troops,—a result due almost wholly
to the navy, although the army bore a share in the
operations at San Fiorenzo and Calvi. To the determination
of Hood and the ardent representations of Nelson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
was due that Bastia was besieged at all; and, as thirty-five
hundred regular troops then surrendered to an outside
force of fourteen hundred seamen and marines, the opinion
of Sir Gilbert Elliott that "the blockade of the port was
the chief means of reducing it," can scarcely be disputed.
At the siege of Calvi Nelson lost his right eye.</p>

<p>Between the siege of Bastia and that of Calvi, the
General Assembly of Corsica met, and on the 19th of
June, 1794, tendered the insular crown to the king of
Great Britain. With the successful issue of the military
operations, this political act consummated the possession of
the island. But, to quote the words of Elliott, the claim
to Corsica rested upon superior force,
<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and by that only
could be asserted; and this superior force the British
government failed to provide. The love of the people for
Paoli, and the period of anxiety through which he and
they had passed, caused the connection to be eagerly desired,
and accepted with demonstrations of the warmest
delight; but as security succeeded the sense of danger, the
first-love between nations so radically distinct in temperament
and institutions was followed by the symptoms
attending ill-assorted unions. Still, with prompt action
and strong garrisons, the benefit of the foreign occupation
might have been manifest, dissatisfaction might have
yielded to considerations of interest, and the island been
retained. The British government acted slowly. Elliott
had urged that authority should be sent him beforehand to
take over the executive functions at once, as soon as the
Act of Union passed; instead of which, Paoli was left for
four months in his old position, and developed a jealousy
of his destined successor not unprecedented in the heads of
states. This feeling, which he held with Corsican intensity,
communicated itself to his followers; and an inauspicious
division of sentiment already existed when, in October,
after an interval of four months, Elliott received his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
powers as viceroy. Paoli continued for a year longer to
reside in Corsica, and up to the time of his departure was
a cause of trouble to the viceroy, and so of strength to
the partisans of France, who became numerous.</p>

<p>During the year 1794 the superior importance of the
operations on the frontiers of Belgium and Germany, as
well as in Spain, caused the French armies of Italy and
the Alps to remain quiet, after some early successes which
had placed in their hands the chief passes of the mountains
and advanced their line on the coast as far as Vado,
on the borders of Genoese territory. Early in 1795 a
force of eighteen thousand men was detached to Toulon
for the invasion of Corsica; but, although the French had
in the port fifteen ships-of-the-line, they felt that neither
the admiral nor the officers possessed the tactical skill
necessary to handle the fleet in presence of an enemy of
nearly equal force, if encumbered with a large body of
transports. The case reproduced that of Conflans, when
expected in 1759 to cover the French invasion of England.
As a rule, in combined military and naval expeditions the
fleet and the army should start together; but the tactical
embarrassment of transports is indisputable. If the fleet
cannot encounter the enemy successfully when not so hampered,
it but encourages disaster to incur the meeting with
them in company. Not improperly, in such a case of doubt,
it was decided that the Toulon fleet should sail alone; and,
accordingly, on the 2d of March, 1795, Admiral Martin put
to sea with fifteen of the line, seven frigates, and five smaller
vessels. Despite these respectable numbers, the efficiency
of the force was poor. Out of twelve thousand
officers and men on board the ships-of-the-line, seventy-five
hundred had never before been to sea; and Martin
reported that, deducting officers and petty-officers, he had
but twenty-seven hundred seamen to man the fleet.
<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Hood had gone home the previous November, expecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
to return; and the British were now commanded by Admiral
Hotham. The latter had cruised off Toulon for three
weeks in mid-winter, on account of the indications of the
French coming out, and after a succession of most violent
weather returned to San Fiorenzo Bay on the 10th of January.
He sailed again, apparently about the 22d of the
month, to cover a convoy expected from England, leaving
in port the "Berwick," seventy-four; which, through the
carelessness of her officers, had been permitted to roll her
masts overboard at her anchors. After some more hard
cruising, the fleet put into Leghorn on the 25th of February,
leaving still in San Fiorenzo Bay the "Berwick,"
the delay in whose repairs can only be attributed to the
penury of naval resources. The presence of the fleet in
Leghorn was probably necessary both for its own supplies
and to remind the wavering Tuscany of the power of Great
Britain at her doors; but the "Berwick" incident served
powerfully to illustrate the far-reaching effects of individual
carelessness and the impolicy of exposing small detachments
not covered, directly or indirectly, by the main
body. On the 7th of March the French fleet came in sight
of Cape Corso, and almost at the same moment discovered
the "Berwick," which had only the previous day succeeded
in leaving San Fiorenzo for Leghorn. Being still crippled,
she was easily overtaken, and forced to surrender at noon.</p>

<p>The following day Hotham in Leghorn learned that the
enemy had sailed, and the next morning at dawn put to
sea in pursuit. On the 11th the two fleets came in sight
of each other, the French far south and to windward of the
British, out of gun-shot, and thus continued during the
12th. That night one of the French seventy-fours lost a
topmast and parted company, reducing their numbers to
fourteen. The following morning the "Ça-Ira," an eighty-gun
ship, ran into her next ahead, losing both fore and
main topmasts, and thus became the source of anxiety and
danger which a crippled ship ever is in the fleet to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
she belongs. As she dropped out of the line, a British
frigate ran close to her on the side encumbered with the
fallen spars, annoying her there for some time with comparative
impunity, and was then succeeded by Nelson in
the "Agamemnon," who hung about on her quarters until
several ships bore down to her relief.</p>

<p>During the night the "Sans Culottes," of one hundred
and twenty guns, the heaviest vessel in the French fleet,
dropped out of the line to leeward, and in the morning was
out of sight. The "Ça-Ira" was taken in tow by, the
"Censeur," seventy-four, and at daybreak these two were
some distance from, and to the north-east of, their fleet.
Both parties were at this time much scattered from the
irregularities of the wind; but it shifting now to the north-west
favored the British, and those nearest the separated
ships speedily brought them to action. While this partial
engagement was going on, both fleets shaped their course
for the scene, the French intending to cover the "Censeur"
and "Ça-Ira" by passing between them and the
British, but owing to some misunderstanding this was not
done. As the two vans went slowly by on opposite tacks,
a sharp exchange of shots took place, in which the British,
not being well closed up, were overmatched, and two of
their number suffered severely; but as the French allowed
the enemy to interpose between them and the disabled vessels,
these were forced to surrender after a very gallant
resistance, in which they lost four hundred men and were
partially dismasted. Each fleet continuing its course in
opposite directions, they soon separated and passed out of
sight.</p>

<p>The baffling character of the wind, combined with the
indifferent sailing qualities of the British three-deckers,
deprive this action of any special tactical significance;
and the very mediocre calibre of the two admirals was
not calculated to overcome the difficulties they encountered.
The numerous accidents in Martin's fleet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the parting of the "Sans Culottes" at such a moment,
show the indifferent character of the French captains, and
probably justify the comment that Hotham owed his success
to the initiative of the admirable officers under his
command rather than to his own capacity. "I went on
board Admiral Hotham," wrote Nelson, "as soon as our
firing grew slack in the van and the 'Ça-Ira' and 'Censeur'
had struck, to propose to him leaving our two crippled
ships, the two prizes, and four frigates, and pursue
the enemy; but he, much cooler than myself, said, 'We
must be contented, we have done very well.' Admiral
Goodall backed me; I got him to write to the Admiral,
but it would not do; we should have had such a day as I
believe the annals of England never produced."
<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> "Admiral
Hotham," says Chevalier,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> "showed great circumspection.
He probably did not appreciate the improvised
fleets of the republic. To fight, there are needed ships in
good condition, capable seamen, skilful gunners, and officers
accustomed to order, to military dispositions, and to
squadron manœuvres. These we did not have." "The
enemy," wrote Nelson about the same fleet, a few months
later, "are neither seamen nor officers."
<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The immediate
consequence of this defeat was the abandonment of the
projected expedition against Corsica.</p>

<p>After the battle a gale of wind forced the British into
Spezia and caused the wreck of the "Illustrious," seventy-four,
which, from injuries received in the action, was
not able to keep off shore. This, with the capture of the
"Berwick," equalized the losses of the two fleets. The
French anchored in Hyères Bay, where they were rejoined
by the "Sans Culottes," and on the 24th of March returned
to Toulon. Admiral Renaudin's arrival from
Brest<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
on the 4th of April raised the available force to
nineteen or twenty ships-of-the-line; to which the enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
could now oppose only thirteen of their own and two
Neapolitan. But, although the British were very destitute
of material for necessary equipment and repair,
<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> the superiority
of organization, discipline, and officer-like training,
allowed them little real cause for anxiety. In the month
of May a Jacobin outbreak occurred in Toulon. The government
had ordered Martin to take advantage of Renaudin's
junction, and again to seek the enemy while thus
superior. The mob raised the cry that as soon as the fleet
sailed the enemies of the Revolution would enter the town
and massacre the patriots. The seamen, except those belonging
to the Brest squadron, left their vessels, under
pretext of deliberating on the dangers of their country,
and took part in all the street demonstrations. An expedition
was even set on foot against Marseille; but the central
government was getting stronger, or rather anarchy
was becoming wearisome, and after a paltry engagement
the Toulonese fell back upon their city and submitted. A
great number of seamen, however, had deserted; and the
necessity of recovering them delayed the departure of the
fleet, which finally put to sea on the 7th of June with seventeen
ships-of-the-line. The time for a favorable sortie
was, however, past; the British having at last received a
large re-enforcement.</p>

<p>After partially refitting in Spezia, Hotham took his fleet
to San Fiorenzo, arriving there on the 30th of March. On
the 17th of April he sailed again for Minorca, where he
hoped to meet a re-enforcement and a much-needed convoy;
but a succession of westerly winds caused the fleet to
lose ground, instead of gaining, until the 27th, when it unexpectedly
and most fortunately met a body of store-ships
from Gibraltar. With these the admiral at once bore up
for Leghorn, arriving there next day. Had the French in
their own dockyards refitted as rapidly as the British did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
in a foreign port, and gone to sea with the increase of
strength that Renaudin brought, they should have intercepted
this important convoy, if they did not bring the fleet
to action. The correspondence of Nelson, still a simple
captain, testifies continually, in his own vivid style, to the
critical state of the campaign at this moment.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May Hotham sailed again for Minorca, and
continued to cruise off that island until the 14th of June,
when Rear-admiral Robert Mann joined him with a re-enforcement
from England of nine<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> ships-of-the-line, making
the British superior in number as in quality to the
enemy. As a convoy was also expected, the fleet kept the
same station until it arrived on the 22d, when the whole
body sailed for San Fiorenzo, anchoring there June 29.
On the 4th of July Hotham sent Nelson with his own ship
and some smaller vessels to co-operate on the Riviera of
Genoa with the Austrian advance against the French; but
the detachment fell in with Martin's fleet, and had to return
to San Fiorenzo, being, says Nelson, "hard pressed"
by the enemy, who pursued until they saw the British fleet
at anchor. The latter weighed as soon as possible, but
did not come up with the French until the 14th, near the
Hyères Islands, where a trifling brush took place, resulting
in the capture of the "Alcide," seventy-four, which immediately
after surrendering caught fire and blew up. This
small affair was the last in which Admiral Hotham was
directly concerned. Hood had been definitively relieved
of the Mediterranean command before he could sail from
England on his return; and Hotham, weary of a burden
to which he felt himself unfitted and had proved himself
unequal, applied for relief, and struck his flag on the 1st
of November, 1795.</p>

<p>Prior to the naval brush off Hyères, little had been done
in Italy by the armies on either side. The French, whose
forces were far inferior to those of the allies and in a state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of great destitution, were compelled to stand on the defensive
over a very long line, of which the advanced post on
the sea was at Vado. The Austrians had imposed upon
the Sardinians their own plan of campaign, which was to
strike the extreme right of the French at Vado, and then
drive them back along the Corniche, while the Sardinians
attacked on the other flank through the passes of the
Apennines up to the Col di Tende, where the Maritime
Alps begin. The British fleet was to co-operate with the
movement on the side of the sea,—a consideration which
had much to do with determining the Austrian plan. By
occupying Vado and the Riviera east of it, the coasting
trade heretofore carried on from the ports of Genoa and
Tuscany to southern France would be stopped; a matter
of great consequence to the republic, as those departments
only raised grain for three months' consumption and depended
for the rest upon that which came from Barbary
and Italy by way of Tuscany. With a British squadron at
Vado, the populace of Provence, the navy at Toulon, and
the army of Italy, would have to be supplied from the
north of France by bad inland roads.
<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Vado Bay was,
moreover, the best anchorage between Nice and Genoa.
Devins, the Austrian general, began his movement on the
13th of June, passing through Genoese territory against
the protest of that neutral government. The French resisted
sturdily; but the odds were too great, and by the
end of June they had fallen back to a line extending from
Borghetto on the sea to Ormea in the mountains, abandoning
Vado and the intermediate coast towns. Devins now
called on Hotham for naval support, and the British admiral
detached Nelson, as has already been seen, to give
it; but the encounter with the French fleet delaying his
arrival for some days served Devins with a pretext for
inaction. He employed the mean time in fortifying his
position and improving the roads in his rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 17th of July Nelson reached Genoa, took on board
the British minister to that republic, and went to Vado,
anchoring there on the 21st. He immediately conferred
with Devins, who gave it as his opinion that the Austrians
could not advance further until the French were compelled
to retire by want of provisions,—a result he expected from
the action of the navy. Nelson explained to the minister
that the food supplies being carried in neutral vessels he was
powerless to stop them; for he had stringent orders from
the admiralty that no legal measures should be instituted
against such, when arrested, until full particulars in each
case had been sent to England and instructions had come
back what to do. Meanwhile the cargoes, being perishable,
would be spoiled. Such utterly inconsequent proceedings,
though highly characteristic of the military action of cabinets,
were most exasperating to a man of Nelson's temper,
always prone to cut knots; but, as he was pecuniarily answerable
and a poor man, he could not disregard them on
his sole authority. The British ministers to Genoa and
Sardinia both concurred in advising him to carry out Devins's
wishes; and then Nelson, with the fearlessness of responsibility
he always showed,—and sometimes out of, as
well as in, season,—issued orders to his frigates to take
every vessel bound to France or to ports within the French
lines, to whatsoever nation it might belong. At the same
time the general also sent out small cruisers; and it is
roundly asserted by Jomini that he laid a tax on all coasting
vessels brought in by them, forcing them to pay for a passport
and appropriating the proceeds to himself. The utmost
diligence, however, could not insure the interruption
of a traffic carried on by very small vessels, having to make
but short night runs close along a coast;
<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and Nelson's orders,
while doubtless productive of some results in stopping
large vessels from Tuscany and Algiers, could not prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
supplies getting in by Genoese coasters. The difficulty was
increased by the fact that a number of the ports in rear of
the French positions belonged to Genoa, and the inhabitants
depended upon her for food. To turn a deaf ear to
their cries of suffering, and to prevent supplies landed there
being used by the French, were alike impossible.</p>

<p>These considerations should have led Devins to regard
naval co-operation simply as the efforts of a light force,
competent to harass, not to destroy, the enemy's communications;
and should have induced him to force his own
way, by early and vigorous action, while the French were
inferior in numbers and before their positions became too
strong. Instead of this, he used the Sardinians and British,
not as allies, but as excuses for not moving; action
of one kind or another on their part was necessary before
he could advance. Thus the summer slipped away, the
French busily strengthening their lines and bringing up
the army of the Pyrenees to re-enforce that of Italy, after
peace was made with Spain. Nelson was full of projects
to embark a corps of Austrians, who should seize and occupy
a coast position in rear of the French; but Devins
only played with a proposition of which Jomini speaks with
scant respect, and which was certainly open to the objection
that, if carried out with adequate force, it divided the
Austrian army. Nelson, it is true, guaranteed its retreat
to his ships in case of need; but the Austrian, not unnaturally,
preferred a less uncertain line. The British captain,
who had at first felt respect for Devins's abilities, wrote on
the 17th of September that it had for some time appeared
to him "that the general intended to go no further than
his present position, and meant to lay the miscarriage
of his enterprise against Nice to the non-co-operation of the
British fleet and the Sardinian army."
<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Whatever his
purpose, Devins did not advance, but quietly awaited the
French attack. Early in November a severe illness caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
him to give up the command; and on the 23d of the month
the enemy, under General Schérer, assaulted vigorously the
centre of the allied position, where the Sardinians touched
the Austrians. This point had always been weak, and after
a short struggle was forced. The original intention of
Schérer had been to turn, after piercing the centre, against
the Sardinians, as Bonaparte did in the following year;
but a very heavy fall of snow in the mountains decided him
to swing round to the right, drive the Austrians back upon
the coast, and, if possible, anticipate them upon their line of
retreat to the eastward. In this he was not entirely successful;
but the imminent danger forced the enemy to
abandon all their line of works and fall back precipitately,
with a loss of seven thousand men, killed, wounded and
prisoners, besides their depots at Loano, Vado, and Savona.
This action, which was a brilliant and decisive victory, is
known as the battle of Loano. By the first of December the
Austrians had recrossed the Apennines and were again in
the positions from which they had set out the previous June.</p>

<p>The military plan and execution of the campaign by the
land forces scarcely falls within the scope of the present
work. An advance by the armies of a coalition, whose respective
troops and lines of operation are separated by a
chain of mountains, even of the height of the Apennines,
with difficult communication across them, does not present
a combination promising mutual support and probable success.
To this disadvantage is to be added that of the long
and narrow line by which all the Austrian supplies had to
be forwarded; and which any successful advance would
make yet longer and more difficult. On the other hand,
the Austrians counted much upon the help that could be
extended by the navy of Great Britain, in whose interest
the occupation of the shore line was undertaken.
<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
their advance they controlled Vado Bay,—the best anchorage
between Villefranche (Nice) and Genoa; and their
presence imposed a restraint upon the latter republic,
whose attitude was largely determined by the comparative
forces of the belligerents. Did then the British navy, under
these circumstances, do all that it could have done to
insure the success of the common cause?</p>

<p>The answer can scarcely be yes. Nelson, indeed, exerted
himself with the energy that never failed him; but
his correspondence shows that he did not think the force
assigned him equal to its task. Could it then have been
increased? The answer again is scarcely doubtful. The
British fleet of the line was slightly superior in numbers
to the French at Toulon, and far superior in the quality of
its officers and men. It was doubtless embarrassed by
numerous duties,—by those conflicting interests whose
divergence imposes the great test of capacity upon a general
officer. The French fleet at Toulon, co-operation with
the Austrian advance, the protection of trade, the covering
of Corsica, the political interests involved in controlling
the action of the small Italian states,—all these cares
fell upon the British admiral. Of these, the French fleet
was the most important; but all other interests of Britain
and her allies were better served by co-operation with the
Austrian advance,—by victory in the field,—than by any
dissemination of force for other purposes. A decisive Imperial
success would have determined the policy of every
state in the western Mediterranean and closed every port
to French cruisers.</p>

<p>In short, offensive action, and not the merely defensive
attitude maintained through the campaign, was here
clearly indicated. Nelson intimates that the only course
by which the navy could practically intercept the French
communications was to enter the coasting ports and destroy
the coasters. These little vessels defied detection on
their voyages; only by chasing them into their nests could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
their wings be clipped. "A few days ago," he writes, "I
scoured the coast between Monaco and Borghetto so completely,
that although I was only able to take one ship
loaded with corn, yet I forced the others into the Bay of
Alassio, where they are so completely under the protection
of formidable batteries <i>that not less than three sail-of-the-line</i>
could attempt to take or destroy them. The number
of vessels loaded and unloaded at those places is near one
hundred, the greater part loaded with stores and corn for
France."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
Here was the strategic direction to be given to
the British navy, after providing for the watch off Toulon.
"You will now," wrote Nelson five years later to Lord
Keith, "bear me out in my assertion, when I say that the
British fleet could have prevented the invasion of Italy;
and if our friend Hotham had kept his fleet on that coast,
I assert, and you will agree with me, no army from France
could have been furnished with stores or provisions; even
men could not have marched."
<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> If the fleet proved unequal
to this task, final condemnation was passed on the
allied plan of campaign, which was not in its conception
characterized by sound military judgment. But Admiral
Hotham, as Nelson said, had "no head for enterprise,
perfectly satisfied that each month passes without
any losses on our side."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Nelson never had under his
orders any other ship-of-the-line than his own "Agamemnon;"
and at the time of the decisive battle of Loano
all his little squadron had been taken away except two, so
that French gunboats harassed with impunity the left
flank of the Austrians.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> He himself at that critical moment
had to remain in Genoa with the "Agamemnon," at
the request of the Imperial minister, to prevent the crew of
a French frigate then in port, supported as it would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
been by French partisans, from seizing Voltri,—an important
point upon the line of retreat of the Austrians, where
a few resolute men could have stopped them until the pursuing
army came up. To him alone was therefore attributed
the escape of several thousand Imperial soldiers,
among whom was the commander-in-chief himself.
<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Prior
to the battle Genoa had permitted French intrigues and
armed enterprises of this character to be concerted, almost
openly, in her territories. This she would not have dared
to do, had the British navy been present in force on the
coast, acting under such a commander as Nelson; for
the probabilities of final success would have been with the
allies. In short, this campaign of the British fleet contributes
another to the numerous lessons of history, upon
the importance of having sufficient force at the decisive
point and taking the offensive. It may be added that
Hotham could better have spared ships to Nelson, if he
had not thrown away his two opportunities of beating the
Toulon fleet.</p>

<p>While Nelson was co-operating with the Austrians as far
as his force admitted, the British fleet was generally cruising
off Toulon, returning from time to time to San Fiorenzo or
Leghorn for refit and stores. It was in this latter part of
the year 1795 that the Directory, as will be remembered,
decided to abandon the policy of fleet-fighting and to enter
upon that of commerce-destroying, directed against exposed
colonies of the enemy as well as against his trade
afloat. Two squadrons, numbering in all seven ships-of-the-line
and eight smaller vessels, were ordered fitted out
at Toulon, which was with difficulty done for want of
seamen. Since the action of July off Hyères, nearly all
the sailors in Martin's fleet had deserted, disgusted with
the bad food, scanty clothing, and constant disaster that
were their portion. Enough, however, were at last gathered
to man the ships selected; and on the 14th of September
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
six of the line and three frigates got away under
the command of Captain Richery. It does not appear
whether the British fleet was then at sea or at San
Fiorenzo; but in either case it was at this port, and not
until September 22d, that Hotham learned their escape.
On the 5th of October this leisurely commander-in-chief
sent Admiral Mann with six of the line in pursuit; but the
French, having so great a start, could not be overtaken.
They passed the Straits of Gibraltar early in October,
bound to the British possessions in North America. On
the 7th of the month, when a hundred and fifty miles west
of Gibraltar, they fell in with an enemy's convoy of thirty-one
merchant ships from the Levant, under the protection
of three seventy-fours. Richery succeeded in capturing
one of the latter, which had lost a topmast, and all the
merchant ships except one. Having so valuable a booty,
he decided to escort it into Cadiz, where he anchored on
the 13th and was soon after found by Mann, whose arrival
prevented his departure to fulfil his original mission. At
about the same time some French frigates in the Atlantic
took eighteen ships out of a Jamaica convoy. The other
Toulon division, of one ship-of-the-line and six smaller
vessels, cruised in the Levant; and, having made a number
of prizes, returned safely to Toulon. Its commander, Captain
Ganteaume, though undistinguished by any great
achievements, was throughout his career remarkably fortunate
in escaping the search of an enemy. It was he who
commanded the flotilla on board which Bonaparte stole
unseen through all the British cruisers, on his return from
Egypt to France in 1799.</p>

<p>These results, coinciding so closely with the adoption
of the new policy of commerce-destroying, confirmed the
government in favor of this course, to which the French
have always been strongly disposed. They hoped from it,
to use the words of a representative in the Convention, "to
force the English to a shameful bankruptcy;" what they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
obtained was the demoralization of their navy, the loss
of the control of the sea and of their own external commerce,
finally Napoleon's Continental System and the fall
of the Empire.</p>

<p>The battle of Loano, decisive of the campaign of 1795,
is yet more distinguished as marking the entrance upon
the scene of two of the most remarkable figures in the war
of the French Revolution. During the week after it was
fought, Admiral Sir John Jervis, better known by his later
title of Earl St. Vincent, arrived at San Fiorenzo, as the
regular successor to Hood in the Mediterranean. During
the winter Napoleon Bonaparte was chosen by the Directory
to relieve Schérer in command of the Army of Italy.</p>

<p>The career and character of the youthful republican
general are too well known, have been too often described,
to be attempted by the author, from whose immediate theme,
moreover, they stand apart. The personality of the already
aged admiral, whose iron hands stamped his own image on
the British navy and fashioned it into the splendid instrument
with which the triumphs of Nelson were won, is, on
the contrary, familiar to few except the students of naval
history. Born in 1734, Sir John Jervis, when he assumed
command of the Mediterranean fleet in his sixty-second
year, had had no opportunity of distinguishing himself in
the eyes of the world outside of the service to which he
belonged. With the members of that service, however,
he had long been a marked man. The child of a poor
though well-born family, he had in early life, under the
pressure of poverty, required of himself the same stern
discipline and submission to the duty of the moment which
he afterwards so rigorously exacted of others. Grave and
unbending in his official relations, immovable as a rock
when his determination was once formed, unrelenting
almost to mercilessness in suppressing insubordination,
then rife throughout the British navy, he had the high-bred
polish of a man used to good society, and his demeanor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
was courteous, and, when occasion demanded,
even courtly. A traveller by land as well as by sea, a
constant and judicious reader, in a period when such habits
were rarer than now among seamen, he was well informed
in matters other than those relating merely to his profession.
Of the latter, however, he was a master. His ship
was the model of the British fleet during the American
Revolution, and his high reputation drew to her quarter-deck
youths from the best families of England, when they
could obtain interest to get there. Yet no man was ever
less swayed, in an age when social and political influence
counted for so much, by any extrinsic claims of that character.
Personal merit first, after that a family claim upon
the navy, that a father or brother had given his life for
the service,—nay, the very friendlessness of a deserving
man,—such were the considerations that determined him
in the use of patronage at his own disposal.</p>

<p>Yet, with all these strong attributes, capable too of a
tenderness which could mourn long and deeply the loss of
a valued comrade, the rule of Jervis was one of fear rather
than love. It is impossible to criticise adversely measures
whose extreme severity was justified, if not imperatively
demanded, by the appalling crisis of the mutinies of 1797;
impossible to withhold admiration, not unmingled with
awe, from the impressive figure of the chief who stood
unmoved and unyielding amid the smothered discontent,
revolt threatening from below, the enemy's coast in sight
from the deck, knowing that in every other fleet the crews
had taken the ships from their officers, but determined it
should not be so in the Mediterranean. Yet admiration is
qualified by the feeling that to the ruthless temper of the
man the position was not wholly displeasing,—that he was
in his natural element when crushing opposition. A captain,
who with great personal courage had quelled a rising
in his ship, dragging the ringleaders with his own hands
from among their followers, interceded on behalf of one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the condemned because he had previously borne a good
character. "I am glad of it," replied Jervis; "hitherto
we have been hanging scoundrels. Now men will know
that no good character will atone for the crime of mutiny."
In lesser matters, also, his tendency was to exaggerate restraint
as well as punishment. "Where I would take a
penknife," said Nelson, "Lord St. Vincent takes a
hatchet."</p>

<p>With such characteristics, accompanied though they
were by resolution and high professional accomplishments,
it is not to be expected that the fire of genius will be found.
Though not an ungenerous man, Lord St. Vincent lacked
the sympathetic qualities that made Nelson at once so lovable
and so great a leader of men. Escaping the erratic
temper and the foibles of his great successor, upon whose
career these defects have left marks ever to be regretted by
those who love his memory, Jervis fell short too of the
inspiration, of the ardor, which in moments of difficulty
lifted Nelson far above the common plane of mankind, and
have stamped his actions with the seal of genius. But
after Nelson, Jervis, though of a different order, stands
first among British commanders-in-chief. For inspiration
he had a cool, sound, and rapid professional judgment; for
ardor, a steady, unflinching determination to succeed; and
these, joined to a perfect fearlessness of responsibility such
as Nelson also showed, have won for him a place in the
first rank of those chieftains, whether sea or land, who
have not received the exceptional endowments of Nature's
favorites. In the one general action which Fortune permitted
to him, the battle of Cape St. Vincent, he illustrated
these traits to a high degree; as Nelson then also
showed that faculty of quick appreciation and instant
action, in which all the processes of thought and will
blend into one overpowering conviction and impulse that
lesser men never know. Whether we consider the vastly
superior numbers then deliberately engaged, the tactics of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the admiral on the battle-field, or his appreciation of the
critical position in which Great Britain then stood, Sir
John Jervis's conduct on that occasion must make the
battle of Cape St. Vincent ever illustrious among the
most brilliant sea-fights of all ages.</p>

<p>To these powerful elements of his nature, Jervis added
a capacity for comprehensive and minute attention to the
details of discipline, order and economy, without which
mere severity would become aimless and productive of
none but bad results. He was fortunate in finding among
the Mediterranean captains an unusual number of men of
consummate seamanship, energy and resources, in all the
vigor of a prime still youthful, who were only waiting for
a master-hand to combine and give direction to their abilities.
With such a head and with such subordinates, the
British Mediterranean fleet soon became a model of efficiency
and spirit, which was probably never equalled in the
days of sailing ships. Nelson so considered it; and the
old admiral himself bewailed its memory several years
later, when commanding the Channel fleet, and complained
testily of the "old women in the guise of young men,"
whom he found in charge of ships off Brest. As an administrator,
when First Lord, the economy of Jervis became
exaggerated into parsimony, and his experience of
the frauds connected with the dockyards of the day led
him into a crusade against them, which was both well
meant and necessary, but particularly ill-timed. It has
consequently left a stigma of failure upon his administration,
which is due, however, not to his executive inefficiency,
but to a misapprehension of the political signs of the
times. Absorbed in reform, and for it desiring quiet, he
saw only peace while the dark clouds of war were gathering
thick on the horizon. Therefore the British navy,
well-worn by the first war, was not ready for that which
followed it in 1803.</p>

<p>Jervis's arrival in the Mediterranean was too late to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
remedy the impending evils. It was a singular misfortune
for Great Britain, that the interregnum between two such
able men as Hood and Jervis should have coincided with
the determination of the French to try the chance of battle
with their Mediterranean fleet, and that the opportunities
they lost should have fallen to so sluggish and cautious an
admiral as Hotham. "To say how much we wanted Lord
Hood on the 13th of July," wrote Nelson, "is to say, Will
you have all the French fleet, or no action?"
<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Accepting
this opinion in the light of Nelson's subsequent achievements,
it may be permitted to think that, if not all the
fleet, so many ships would have fallen as to have prevented
the sailing of Richery's squadron and the consequent necessary
detachment of Admiral Mann; while the loss of seamen
captured would have seriously crippled the operations
of the flotilla, which from Toulon supplied the Army of
Italy with ammunition, artillery and stores. Light guns
on mountain carriages could be carried along the Corniche;
but at the opening of Bonaparte's operations all heavy guns,
and artillery outfits of all kinds, had to be taken by sea
from Nice to Savona.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
The demands of this flotilla necessitated
the laying up of the fleet,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>—a matter of less
consequence as the determination to resort to commerce-destroying
had then been reached. The French navy therefore
became, through the flotilla, a very important part of
Bonaparte's communications; and it has already been
pointed out that sailing ships could not break up, though
they might much disturb, the voyages of the smaller vessels
employed on a difficult coast, with batteries under which to
take refuge.</p>

<p>After the battle of Loano, Nelson, whose occupation on
the Gulf of Genoa was for the time over, went to Leghorn
to refit his ship, then nearly three years in commission.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Not till January 19,1796, did he join Jervis, who since his
arrival on the station had, for the most part, remained in
San Fiorenzo organizing his fleet. The new admiral
showed him the same confidence as his predecessors, and
sent him at once to his old station, with a light division,
to prevent any small number of men making a descent
upon Italy. A predominant idea, one might almost call it a
fad, in Nelson's mind, was the landing of a body of men
from ships in rear of the enemy. As has been seen, he
was forward to recommend such an attempt to Devins,
promising to support it with his squadron; and the intelligence
concerning flat-boats and gunboats prepared in the
French ports suggested nothing to his mind so much as
transporting troops to Tuscany, in rear of the Austrians,
while the main French army operated in their front. Like
Bonaparte, Nelson recognized the resources which the
plains of Piedmont, Lombardy and Tuscany would offer to
the needy enemy. He called them a gold mine; but he
did not understand the weakness of the French in seamen,
nor realize the improbability of Bonaparte's attempting
such a use of his troops as would put them far out of
mutual support and away from his own control. Certainly
no indication of such a purpose is to be found in his correspondence
or in the instructions of the Directory to him.
On the contrary, he had strongly advised against a pet
project of the Committee of Public Safety, early in 1795,
to land an expedition in the papal states,—unless with
control of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Had the Austrians again advanced to the sea and occupied
Vado, Jervis would undoubtedly have supported
them and harassed the French to a very important extent.
Nelson gave express assurances on that point.
<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Bonaparte,
however, allowed him no opportunity. Leaving Paris on
the 14th of March, 1796, the young general reached Nice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
on the 27th of the month. On the 5th of April he moved
his headquarters to Albenga, and on the 9th to Savona. On
the 10th Beaulieu, the new Austrian general, began to move
his left wing by the pass of La Bochetta, his right by that
of Montenotte; the junction to be formed at Savona.
Quick as lightning, Bonaparte struck at once where the
Austrian right touched the Sardinian left. Blow followed
blow upon the centre of the allies, and after six days'
fighting their armies were definitively separated. Driving
the Sardinians before him in unremitting pursuit, Bonaparte
on the 28th granted an armistice, by which three of
the principal fortresses of Piedmont were put into his possession
and plenipotentiaries dispatched to Paris to treat
for peace. This was concluded and signed on the 15th of
May. Sardinia abandoned the coalition, surrendered the
counties of Savoy and Nice, and yielded other conditions
favorable to France,—particularly in the boundary lines
traced on the crests of the mountains, where the commanding
military positions were given to the republic. Thus
the gates of Italy were forced; and Austria, stripped of her
ally on shore and cut off from the British at sea, alone
confronted Bonaparte.</p>

<p>The French were now in the plains of Piedmont, with
Lombardy before them. Beaulieu, expecting an advance
against Milan by the north bank of the Po, had withdrawn
across that river, intending to dispute its passage. If
forced, he would cover Milan by falling back successively
upon the lines of the Sesia and the Ticino, tributaries of
the main stream. Bonaparte, however, was not the man
to attack an enemy in front and force him back along his
natural line of retreat to his proper base. Weighing accurately
the political and military conditions of the peninsula,
he had fixed his eye upon the line of the Adige as
that which he wished to reach and hold, and which, under
all the circumstances, he believed he could master. The
Adige flows from the Tyrol south along the east shore of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the Lake of Garda, then turns to the eastward and enters
the Adriatic between the Po and Venice. Occupying it, the
French army would cover all the valleys of the Po, lay
tribute upon their resources as well as upon those of the
small states south of the river, interpose between Austria
and southern Italy, and isolate Mantua, the enemy's great
stronghold. Making, therefore, a feint of following Beaulieu
by the methodical front attacks expected by him,
Bonaparte pushed his main force stealthily along the south
bank of the Po. On the 7th of May the advance-guard
reached Piacenza, and crossed at once by boats. On the
9th a bridge was completed over the river, which at this
point is fifteen hundred feet wide and very rapid. Beaulieu's
intended positions on the Sesia and Ticino were thus
turned, and the Austrians necessarily fell back to the line
of the Adda. On the 10th of May, just one month after
Beaulieu began his forward movements, the bridge of Lodi,
over the Adda, was carried; and the Austrians again fell
back to the Mincio, the outlet of the Lake of Garda, uncovering
Milan. On the 15th Bonaparte entered Milan in
triumph. Here he paused for ten days, and, after quitting
the place, had to return to punish a revolt which broke out
among the people; but on the 30th of May the French
crossed the Mincio, the Austrians retreating northward
toward the Tyrol, along the east shore of the Lake of
Garda.</p>

<p>This retrograde movement left Mantua to itself. On the
3d of June Bonaparte's headquarters were at Verona,—a
strongly fortified place bestriding the Adige, thus insuring
an easy transit to either side of the river, and which derives
further strategic importance from its topographical
position. A number of spurs run south from the Tyrol
along the Lake of Garda and fall into the plain at Verona,
which thus stands at the foot of the valleys formed by
them. On either side of this cluster of spurs lie the valleys
of the Adige and the Brenta, the two probable lines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
by which an Austrian attack would come. Verona, therefore,
was a central point with reference to any offensive
movements of the enemy, and became the pivot upon
which Bonaparte's strategy hinged. On the 4th of June
Mantua was blockaded. Having now compassed his first
objective, Bonaparte passed temporarily from the offensive
to the defensive, ceased his advance, and occupied himself
with assuring the line of the Adige and pressing the siege
of Mantua.</p>

<p>There remained only to realize the political advantages
gained by his wonderful successes. The Duke of Parma
had entered into a convention on the 9th of May, followed
in the same course on the 17th by the Duke of Modena.
On the 5th of June the Court of Naples, startled out of its
dream of security, signed an armistice, withdrawing its
troops from the coalition and its ships from the British
fleet,—a precipitate abandonment of the common cause as
ill-judged as it was cowardly. At that very moment the
French leader was writing, "I see but one means not to be
beaten in the autumn; and that is, so to arrange matters
that we shall not be obliged to advance into southern
Italy."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
The Pope still holding out, Bonaparte improved
the time which the Austrians must need to prepare a new
movement, by marching into the papal states a corps under
Augereau, whom he followed in person. On the 19th
Bologna was reached, and on the 24th the Pope signed an
armistice. Coincidently with this advance, it was felt
safe and opportune to send into Tuscany a division taken
from the corps occupying Piedmont. This detachment entered
Leghorn on the 28th of June, occupied the port despite
the neutrality of Tuscany, drove out and broke up
the great British commercial and naval interests centred
there, and obtained a secure base for the intended attempt
upon Corsica.</p>

<p>The failure of the Austrians to reach the coast, and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
subsequent retreat, of course put an end to any direct co-operation
between them and the British fleet. Jervis was
forced to confine himself to watching the Toulon ships,—an
operation conducted in the same spirit and on the same
system which he afterwards imparted to the Brest blockade,
and generally to that of all hostile arsenals. For
over six months, from the beginning of April to the middle
of October, he cruised with fifteen sail-of-the-line off the
port; the heavy ships remaining some distance from it,
but near enough to support a light division of three seventy-fours,
which kept just out of range of the batteries,
about two miles from the entrance. By unremitting care
and foresight, the ships on this arduous service were provisioned,
watered and repaired on the spot, without going
into harbor. Nelson, as the year before, was actively employed
in the Gulf of Genoa, harassing the coast communications,
and was on one occasion fortunate enough to
capture a convoy with guns and entrenching tools for the
siege of Mantua. In the Adriatic, a few frigates and a
flotilla of small vessels were engaged in protecting the
Austrian communications by way of Trieste. Admiral
Mann, with seven ships-of-the-line, was still off Cadiz, in
the station assigned him by Hotham to watch Richery.
Besides these strictly military operations, ships were called
for in every direction to convoy trade, to cover the passage
of storeships, and generally to keep the sea safe for unarmed
British vessels, whether traders or government
transports, upon whom depended the supplies of the fleet
and those of Gibraltar drawn from Barbary. Between
thirty and forty frigates and smaller vessels were thus occupied,
and were found insufficient to meet the varied demands
arising from the wide diffusion of British commerce
and the activity of French cruisers.</p>

<p>Bonaparte's rapid successes and wide flight of conquest
materially affected the British fleet; and the question of
supplies became very serious with the ports of Tuscany,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Naples and the Pope closed to its aid. Growing symptoms
of discontent made the tenure of Corsica doubtful, with
the French in Leghorn, and with Genoa tolerating their intrigues
through fear of their armies. As early as May 20,
immediately after entering Milan, Bonaparte had sent
agents to Genoa to concert risings in the island; and in
July he began to collect in Leghorn a body of Corsican
refugees, at whose head he put General Gentili, also a native.
The threatening outlook of affairs, and the submission
of Tuscany to the violation of her neutrality by the
French, determined the viceroy of Corsica to seize Elba,
although a Tuscan possession. Nelson, with a small
squadron, appeared before Porto Ferrajo on the 10th of
July, and to a peremptory summons received immediate
surrender. Being very small, Elba was more immediately
under naval control than Corsica, and to hold it required
fewer troops. In case of the loss of the larger island, it
would still assure the British a base in the Mediterranean
and continued control, so long as their fleet could assert
predominance over those of their enemies.</p>

<p>Some doubt, however, was felt on this latter point. The
attitude of Spain, far from cordial when an ally, had been
cold as a neutral, and was now fast becoming hostile.
The decrepit kingdom had a navy of over fifty sail-of-the-line;
and, although its discipline and efficiency were at
the lowest ebb, the mere force of numbers might prove too
much for even Jervis's splendid fleet of only twenty-two,—seven
of which were still before Cadiz, a thousand miles
from the main body off Toulon. Foreseeing the approaching
danger, Jervis, about the time Elba was seized, sent
Mann orders to rejoin him; and accordingly, on the 29th
of July, the blockade of Cadiz was raised. It was just in
time, for on the 19th of August Spain, moved by the successes
of Bonaparte and the French advance into Germany,—which
had not yet undergone the disasters afterwards
inflicted upon the separated armies of Jourdan and Moreau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
by the Archduke Charles,—had signed a treaty of offensive
and defensive alliance with the republic. As soon as
Mann's ships disappeared, Richery demanded the help of
the Spanish fleet to cover his departure, and on the 4th of
August sailed in company with twenty Spanish ships-of-the-line.
These escorted him three hundred miles to the
westward, and then returned to port, leaving the French to
fulfil their original mission against British North America,
after a detention of nearly ten months. Richery, who had
been promoted to rear-admiral during this time, made his
cruise successfully, harassed the fishing interests on the
coasts of Newfoundland, captured and burned a hundred
British merchant vessels, and got back to Brest in time to
take part in the unfortunate expedition against Ireland,
which sailed in December of this year.</p>

<p>Admiral Mann, though a brave and good officer, showed
bad judgment throughout this campaign. Apparently, to
use Napoleon's expression, "Il s'était fait un tableau" as
to the military and naval situation; and to such a frame
of mind the governor of Gibraltar, O'Hara, a pessimist by
temperament,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
probably was a bad adviser. In his precipitation
to join the commander-in-chief, he forgot the difficulty
about stores and left Gibraltar without filling up.
Jervis consequently was forced to send him back at once,
with orders to return as quickly as possible. On his way
down, on the 1st of October, he was chased by a Spanish
fleet of nineteen sail-of-the-line under Admiral Langara.
His squadron escaped, losing two merchant vessels under
its convoy; but, upon arriving in Gibraltar, he called a
council of captains, and, having obtained their concurrence
in his opinion, sailed for England, in direct disregard of the
commands both of Jervis and the Admiralty. Upon his
arrival his action was disapproved,
<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> orders were sent him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
to strike his flag and come ashore, and he appears never
again to have been employed afloat; but, when it is remembered
that only forty years had elapsed since Byng
was shot for an error in judgment, it must be owned men
had become more merciful.</p>

<p>Mann's defection reduced Jervis's forces by one third, at
a time when affairs were becoming daily more critical.
Not only did it make the tenure of the Mediterranean
vastly more difficult, but it deprived the admiral of his
cherished hope of dealing a staggering blow to the Spanish
fleet, such as four months later he inflicted at Cape St.
Vincent. After meeting Mann, Langara was joined by
seven ships from Cartagena, and with this increase of force
appeared on the 20th of October about fifty miles from San
Fiorenzo Bay. Jervis had just returned there from off
Toulon, having on the 25th of September received orders
to evacuate Corsica,—an operation which promised to be
difficult from lack of transports. On the 26th of October
Langara entered Toulon, where the new allies had then
thirty-eight ships-of-the-line collected.</p>

<p>During the summer months Nelson had blockaded Leghorn,
after its occupation by the French; and this measure,
with the tenure of Elba, seems to have effectually prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
any large body of men passing into Corsica. On the 18th
of September the little island of Capraja, a Genoese dependency
and convenient refuge for small boats, was seized
for the same object. On the 29th, however, Nelson received
orders from Jervis for the evacuation of Corsica, the
operations at Bastia being assigned to his special care. As
soon as the determination of the British was known, discontent
broke out into revolt. Gentili, finding the sea clear,
landed on the 19th of October, pressing close down upon
the coast; and the final embarkation was only effected in
safety under the guns of the ships. On the 19th Nelson
took off the last of the troops, and carried them with the
viceroy to Elba, which it was intended still to hold. Jervis
held on at San Fiorenzo Bay to the latest moment possible,
everything being afloat for a fortnight before he left,
hoping that Mann might yet join, and fearing he might
arrive after the departure of the fleet. On the 2d of November
provisions were so short that longer delay was impossible;
and the admiral sailed with his whole force,
reaching Gibraltar, after a tedious voyage, on the 1st of December,
1796. During the passage, in which the crews were
on from half to one third the usual rations, Jervis received
instructions countermanding the evacuation, if not yet carried
out. If executed, Elba was still to be held.</p>

<p>The policy of thus evacuating the Mediterranean admits,
now as then, of argument on both sides. The causes for the
vacillation of the British government are apparent. The
first orders to leave everything, Elba included, were dated
August 31. Generals Jourdan and Moreau were then far
in the heart of Germany; and the archduke having but
just begun the brilliant counter-move by which he drove
first one, and then the other, back to the Rhine, the effects
of this were in no way foreseen. From Italy the latest
possible news was of Bonaparte's new successes at Lonato
and Castiglione, and the fresh retreat of the Austrians.
The countermanding orders, dated October 21, were issued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
under the influence of the archduke's success and of
Wurmser's evasion of Bonaparte and entrance into Mantua;
whereby, despite repeated defeats in the field, the garrison
was largely increased and the weary work of the siege
must be again begun. While Mantua stood, Bonaparte
could not advance; and the Austrians were gathering a
new army in the Tyrol. The British government failed,
too, to realize the supreme excellence of its Mediterranean
fleet and the stanch character of its leader. "The admiral,"
wrote Elliott<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
on the spot, "is as firm as a rock.
He has at present fourteen sail-of-the-line against thirty-six,
or perhaps forty. If Mann joins him, they will certainly
attack, and they are <i>all</i> confident of victory." The
incident of Mann's conduct, under these circumstances, is
full of military warning. It is within the limits of reasonable
speculation to say that, had he obeyed his orders,—and
only extreme causes could justify disobedience,—the
battle of Cape St. Vincent would have been fought then in
the Mediterranean,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
instead of in the Atlantic after the
fall of Mantua, and would have profoundly affected the
policy of the Italian States. With such a victory, men
like Jervis and Elliott would have held on for further orders
from home. "The expulsion of the English," wrote Bonaparte,
"has a great effect upon the success of our military
operations in Italy. We must exact more severe conditions
of Naples. It has the greatest moral influence upon the
minds of the Italians, assures our communications and will
make Naples tremble even in Sicily."
<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>In the opinion of the author, Sir Gilbert Elliott expresses
the correct conclusion in the words following,
which show singular foresight as well as sound political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
judgment: "I have always thought that it is a great and
important object in the contest between the French republic
and the rest of Europe, that Italy, in whole or in
part, should neither be annexed to France as dominion, nor
affiliated in the shape of dependent republics; and I have
considered a superior British fleet in the Mediterranean as
an essential means for securing Italy and Europe from
such a misfortune."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Elliott's presentiments were realized
by Napoleon at a later day; the immediate effect of the
evacuation was indicated by a treaty of peace between
France and Naples, signed October 10, as soon as the purpose
was known. In 1796 the British fleet had been three
years in the Mediterranean, and since the acquisition of
Corsica had effected little. What was needed at the moment
was not an abandonment of the field, but a demonstration
of power by a successful battle. The weakest eyes
could count the units by which the allied fleets exceeded
the British; acts alone could show the real superiority, the
predominance in strength, of the latter. That demonstrated,
the islands and the remote extremities of the peninsula
would have taken heart, and a battle in the Gulf of
Lyon had the far-reaching effects produced by that in
Aboukir Bay. At the time of the evacuation the three
most important factors in the military situation were, the
siege of Mantua, the Austrian army in the Tyrol, and, last
but not least, the British fleet in the Mediterranean. This
sustained Naples; and Naples, or rather southern Italy,
was one of Bonaparte's most serious anxieties. Finally, it
may be said that the value of Corsica to the fleet is proved
by Nelson's preference of Maddalena Bay, in the straits
separating Corsica from Sardinia, over Malta, as the
station for a British fleet watching Toulon.</p>

<p>Immediately upon reaching Gibraltar, Jervis received
orders to take the fleet to Lisbon, in consequence of a disposition
shown by the allied French and Spanish governments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
to attack Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The limits of his command
were extended to Cape Finisterre. Before sailing, he despatched
Nelson up the Mediterranean with two frigates to
bring off the garrison and stores from Elba, the abandonment
of which was again ordered. On the 16th he sailed
for Lisbon, arriving there on the 21st; but misfortunes
were thickening around his fleet. On the 10th, at Gibraltar,
during a furious gale, three ships-of-the-line drove
from their anchors. One was totally lost on the coast of
Morocco, and another struck so heavily on a rock that she
had to be sent to England for repairs. Shortly after, a
third grounded in Tangiers Bay, and, though repaired
on the station, was unfit for service in the ensuing battle.
A fourth, when entering the Tagus in charge of a pilot,
was run on a shoal and wrecked. Finally, in leaving
the river on the 18th of January, a ninety-eight-gun ship
was run aground and incapacitated. This reduced the
force with which he then put to sea to seek the enemy
to ten ships-of-the-line.</p>

<p>Nelson, his most efficient lieutenant, was also nearly
lost to him on that interesting occasion, when his fearlessness
and <i>coup d'œil</i> mainly contributed to the success
achieved. Sailing from Gibraltar on the 15th of December,
he fought on the 20th a severe action with two Spanish
frigates, which would have made a chapter in the life
of an ordinary seaman, but is lost among his other deeds.
His prizes were immediately recovered by a heavy Spanish
squadron, but his own ships escaped. On the 26th he
reached Porto Ferrajo, and remained a month. He was
there joined by Elliott, the late viceroy of Corsica, who
had been in Naples since the evacuation. General De
Burgh, commanding the garrison, refused to abandon his
post without specific orders from the government, and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Nelson had only those of Jervis, he confined himself to
embarking the naval stores. With these and all the ships
of war he sailed from Elba on the 29th of January, 1797.
On the 9th of February he reached Gibraltar; and thence,
learning that the Spanish fleet had repassed the Straits,
he hurried on to join the admiral. Just out of Gibraltar
he was chased by several Spaniards,
<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> but escaped them,
and on the 13th fell in with the fleet. At 6 <span class="sc">P. M.</span> of that
day he went on board his own ship, the "Captain," seventy-four,
at whose masthead flew his broad pennant
<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
during the battle of the following day.</p>

<p>The meeting which now took place between the Spanish
and British fleets was the result of the following movements.
Towards the end of 1796 the Directory, encouraged
by Bonaparte's successes and by the Spanish alliance,
and allured by the promises of disaffected Irish, determined
on an expedition to Ireland. As the first passage of the
troops and their subsequent communications would depend
upon naval superiority, five ships-of-the-line were ordered
from Toulon to Brest. This force, under Admiral Villeneuve,
sailed on the 1st of December, accompanied by the
Spanish fleet of twenty-six ships, which, since October, had
remained in Toulon. On the 6th Langara went into Cartagena,
leaving Villeneuve to himself, and on the 10th the
French passed Gibraltar in full sight of the British fleet,
driving before the easterly gale, which then did so much
harm to Jervis's squadron and prevented pursuit. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
did not, however, reach Brest soon enough for the expedition.
The Spaniards remained in Cartagena nearly two
months, during which time Admiral Cordova took command;
but under urgent pressure from the Directory
<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
they finally sailed for Cadiz on the 1st of February, passing
the Straits on the 5th with heavy easterly weather,
which drove them far to the westward. They numbered
now twenty-seven ships-of-the-line.</p>

<p>Sir John Jervis, after leaving Lisbon on January 18,
1797, had convoyed to the westward some Portuguese
merchant ships bound to Brazil, and then beaten back
towards his station off Cape St. Vincent. On the 6th of
February he was joined by a re-enforcement of five ships,
which were sent from England as soon as the scare about
Ireland had passed. With these fifteen he cruised off the
Cape, knowing that he there must meet any squadron,
from either the Mediterranean or the Atlantic, bound to
Cadiz. At 5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> of February 14, the frigate "Niger,"
which had kept sight of the Spanish fleet for some days,
joined the admiral, and informed him that it was probably
not more than ten or twelve miles distant, to the southward
and westward. The wind, which had been strong
south-easterly for several days, had changed during the
night to west by south, enabling the Spaniards to head for
Cadiz, after the weary battling of the past week; but this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
otherwise fortunate circumstance became a very dangerous
incident<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
to a large, ill-officered, and ill-commanded body of
ships, about to meet an enemy so skilful, so alert, and so
thoroughly drilled as Jervis's comparatively small and
manageable force. At daybreak, about 6.30, the Spaniards
were seen, stretching on the horizon from south-west to
south in an ill-defined body, across the path of the advancing
British. Their distance, though not stated, was probably
not less than fifteen to twenty miles. The British
fleet being close hauled on the starboard tack, heading
from south to south by west, while the Spaniards, bound
for Cadiz, were steering east-south-east, the two courses
crossed nearly at right angles. At this moment there was
a great contrast between the arrays presented by the approaching
combatants. The British, formed during the
night in two columns of eight and seven ships respectively,
elicited the commendation of their exacting chief "for
their admirable close order."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The Spaniards, on the contrary,
eager to get to port, and in confusion through the
night shift of wind and their own loose habits of sailing,
were broken into two bodies. Of these the leading one, as
all were sailing nearly before the wind, was most to leeward.
It was composed of six ships, the interval between which and
the other twenty-one was probably not less than eight
miles. Even after the British fleet was seen, no attempt
was for some time made to remedy this fatal separation;
a neglect due partly to professional nonchalance and inefficiency,
and partly to misinformation concerning the
enemy's force, which they had heard through a neutral was
only nine ships-of-the-line.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a>

<p>The weather being hazy and occasionally foggy, some
time passed before the gradually approaching enemies
could clearly see each other. At 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> the number and
rates of the Spaniards could be made out from the masthead
of the British flag-ship, so that they were then probably
distant from twelve to fifteen miles. At half-past nine
Jervis sent three ships ahead to chase, and a few minutes
later supported them with three others. This advanced
duty enabled these six to take the lead in the attack.
About ten<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
the fog lifted and disclosed the relative situations.
The British, still in two columns, were heading fair
for the gap in the Spanish order. The six lee ships of the
latter had realized their false position, and were now close
to the wind on the port tack, heading about north-north-west,
in hopes that they could rejoin the main body to
windward, which still continued its course for Cadiz. Jervis
then made signal to form a single column, the fighting
order of battle, and pass through the enemy's line. It
soon became evident that the lee Spanish ships could not
cross the bows of the British. For a moment they wavered
and bore up to south-east; but soon after five of them resumed
their north-west course, with the apparent purpose
of breaking through the hostile line whose advance they
had not been able to anticipate.
<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The sixth continued to
the south-east and disappeared.</p>

<p>The weather division of the Spaniards now also saw that
it was not possible for all its members to effect a junction
with the separated ships. Three stood on, and crossed the
bows of the advancing enemy; the remainder hauled up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
increasing disorder to the northward, steering a course
nearly parallel, but directly opposite, to the British, and
passing their van at long cannon shot. At half-past eleven
the "Culloden," Captain Troubridge, heading Jervis's
column, came abreast the leading ships of this body, and
opened fire. Sir John Jervis now saw secured to him the
great desire of commanders-in-chief. His own force, in
compact fighting order, was interposed between the fractions
of the enemy, able to deal for a measurable time with
either, undisturbed by the other. Should he attack the
eighteen weather, or the eight lee ships, with his own fifteen?
With accurate professional judgment he promptly
decided to assail the larger body; because the smaller, having
to beat to windward, would be kept out of action longer
than he could hope if he chose the other alternative. The
decision was in principle identical with that which determined
Nelson's tactics at the Nile. The signal was therefore
made to tack in succession, in pursuit of the weather
ships. Troubridge, anticipating the order, had already
hoisted at the masthead his answering flag of recognition,
rolled up after the manner of the sea, needing but a turn
of the wrist to unloose it. Quick as the admiral's signal
flew the reply fluttered out, and the "Culloden's" sails
were already shaking as she luffed up into the wind.
"Look at Troubridge," shouted Jervis, in exultation: "he
handles his ship as if the eyes of all England were upon
him! and would to God they were!" The rear of the
Spaniards was just passing the "Culloden" as she thus
went round. Ship after ship of the British line tacked in
her wake and stood on in pursuit; while those still on the
first course, south by west, interposed between the two
Spanish divisions. Of these the lee, led by a hundred-gun
ship under a vice-admiral's flag, headed towards Jervis's
flag-ship, the "Victory," the seventh in the British order,
as though to go through the line ahead of her. The "Victory"
was too prompt; and the Spaniard, to avoid collision,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
went about close under the British broadsides. In
doing this he was exposed to and received a raking fire,
which drove him out of action, accompanied by his consorts.
The "Victory," which had backed a topsail a moment
to aim more accurately, then stood on and tacked in
the wake of the "Culloden," followed by the rest of the
British column.</p>

<p>It was now nearly one o'clock. The action so far had
consisted, first, in piercing the enemy's line, cutting off
the van and greater part of the centre from the rear; and,
second, in a cannonade between two columns passing on
opposite parallel courses,—the Spanish main division running
free, the British close to the wind. Naval history
abounds in instances of these brushes, and pronounces
them commonly indecisive. Jervis, who had seen such,
<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
meant decisive action when he ordered the "Culloden" to
tack and follow the enemy. But a stern chase is a long
chase, and the Spanish ships were fast sailers. Some time
must pass before Troubridge and his companions could
overtake them; and, as each succeeding vessel of the British
line had to reach the common point of tacking, from
which the Spaniards were steadily receding, the rear of
Jervis's fleet must be long in coming up. That it was so
is proved by the respective losses incurred. It has, therefore,
been suggested that the admiral would have done
well to tack his whole fleet, or at least the rear ships together,
bringing them in a body on the Spanish van. The
idea is plausible, but errs by leaving out of the calculation
the Spanish lee division, which was kept off by the British
rear ships. Those eight lee ships are apt to be looked on
as wholly out of the affair; but in fact it was a necessary
part of Jervis's combination to check them, during the time
required to deal with the others. Admiral Parker, commanding
in the van, speaks expressly of the efforts made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
by the Spanish lee division to annoy him, and of the covering
action of the British rear.
<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Thus, one by one, the British ships were changing their
course from south by west to north-north-east in pursuit
of the Spanish main division, and the latter was gradually
passing to the rear of their enemy's original order. When
they saw the sea clear to the south-east, about one o'clock,
they bore up, altering their course to east-south-east, hoping
to pass behind the British and so join the lee division.
Fortunately for Jervis, Nelson was in the third ship from
the rear. Having fully divined his chief's purpose, he saw
it on the point of defeat, and, without waiting for orders,
wore at once out of the line, and threw the "Captain,"
alone, in front of the enemy's leading ships. In this well-timed
but most daring move, which illustrates to the highest
degree the immense difference between a desperate and
a reckless action, Nelson passed to the head of the British
column, crossing the bows of five large Spanish vessels,
and then with his seventy-four engaged the "Santisima
Trinidad," of one hundred and thirty guns, the biggest
ship at that time afloat. The enemy, apparently dashed
by this act of extraordinary temerity, and as little under
control as a flock of frightened sheep, hauled up in a
body again to north-north-east, resuming what can only
be described as their flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Their momentary change of course had, however, caused
a delay which enabled the British leaders to come up.
Troubridge in the "Culloden" was soon right behind Nelson,
to whom he was dear beyond all British officers, and
three other ships followed in as close array as was consistent
with the free use of their guns. The Spaniards, never
in good order, lay before them in confusion, two or three
deep, hindering one another's fire, and presenting a target
that could not easily be missed. This closing scene of the
battle raged round the rear ships of the Spanish main body,
and necessarily became a <i>mêlée</i>, each British captain acting
according to his own judgment and the condition of his ship.
A very distinguished part fell to Collingwood, likewise a
close associate of Nelson's, whose ship, the "Excellent,"
had brought up the rear of the order. Having, probably
from this circumstance, escaped serious injury to her spars,
she was fully under her captain's control, and enabled
him to display the courage and skill for which he was
so eminently distinguished. Passing along the enemy's
rear, he had compelled one seventy-four to strike, when
his eye caught sight of Nelson's ship lying disabled on the
starboard side, and within pistol shot, of the "San Nicolas,"
a Spanish eighty; "her foretopmast and wheel shot away,
not a sail, shroud, or rope, left,"
<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and being fired upon by
five hostile ships. With every sail set he pressed ahead,
passing between the "Captain" and her nearest enemy,
brushing the latter at a distance of ten feet, and pouring
in one of those broadsides of which he used to assure his
practised crew that, if they could fire three in five minutes,
no vessel could resist them. The "San Nicolas," either
intentionally or from the helmsman being killed, luffed
and fell on board the "San Josef," a ship of one hundred
and twelve guns, while the "Excellent," continuing her
course, left the ground again clear for Nelson. The latter,
seeing the "Captain" powerless for continued manœuvre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
put the helm to starboard; the British ship came up to
the wind, fetched over to the "San Nicolas," and grappled
her. Nelson, having his men ready on deck, rushed at
their head on board the Spaniard, drove her crew below,
and captured her. The "San Josef," which was fast to
the "San Nicolas" on the other side, now opened a fire of
musketry; but the commodore, first stationing sentinels to
prevent the "San Nicolas's" men regaining their deck,
called upon his own ship for a re-enforcement, with which
he boarded the three-decker and carried her also. On her
quarter-deck, surrounded by his followers still hot from
the fight, he received the swords of the Spanish officers.</p>

<p>This dramatic ending to the distinguished part played by
him, and the promptitude of his previous action, by which,
while assuming a great responsibility, he saved the success
of the day, have made Nelson the most striking figure in
the battle of Cape St. Vincent; or, as it is sometimes
called, of St. Valentine's Day. This splendid movement of
his genius in no way detracts from the credit due to the commander-in-chief;
as it was no lessening of Nelson's own
fame that the leader of the van at the Nile conceived on
the moment the happy thought of passing inside the French
line. To Jervis alone belongs the honor of attacking such
heavy odds, as well as of the correct and sufficient combination
by which he hoped to snatch victory from superior
numbers. He was happy, indeed, in having such a lieutenant,
so right a man in so right a place, and at so critical a
moment; but the whole responsibility and the whole original
plan was his, and no man can take it from him. To him,
too, was primarily due the admirable efficiency of his fleet,
which removed from his enterprise the reproach of rashness
to bestow upon it the praise of daring. A yet higher meed
of glory is due to this bold admiral. As the dull morning
light showed him the two fleets, he was heard to say, "A
victory is very essential to England at this moment."
Honor to the chief who can rise above his own anxieties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and his local responsibilities to think of the needs of his
country, and who is willing to risk his own reputation to
support her credit.</p>

<p>Four Spanish ships were now in the possession of the
British, and the great "Santisima Trinidad" was without
fore or mizzen mast,—some said she had struck; but the lee
division of the enemy was at last coming up, and many of
the weather were still uninjured. Jervis, therefore, about
four in the afternoon formed his fleet in line on the starboard
tack, interposing it between the enemy and his prizes.
This ended the battle. It has been thought that further
pursuit of a fleet so disgracefully beaten would have increased
the British triumph; but Jervis was not the man
to risk a substantial success, securely held, for a doubtful
further gain. The victory essential to Great Britain was
won; the worthlessness of the Spanish navy was revealed,—it
could no longer be accounted a factor in the political situation.
In the opinion of the author, Jervis was right not to
expose this, the great and attained result of Valentine's
Day, to those chances of mishap that cannot be excluded
from the operations of war.</p>

<p>Among the numerous rewards bestowed for this action,
the admiral was advanced to the peerage as Earl St. Vincent,
while upon Nelson was bestowed the then distinguished
honor of Knight of the Bath. On the 20th of
February he was made a rear-admiral. The captains of
the fleet received medals, and the senior lieutenant of each
ship was promoted.</p>

<p>Jervis had well said that Great Britain was then in essential
need of a victory; and never was one better timed for
political effect. Deep gloom prevailed throughout the country,
and in every quarter the horizon was black with clouds,
when, on the 3d of March, the bearer of the dispatches
reached the admiralty. Since Bonaparte had seized the
line of the Adige and cut off Mantua, three distinct attempts
had been made by the Austrians in superior force to dislodge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
him and relieve the city; and in all three they had
been beaten with heavy loss. The news was but lately
come that Mantua had capitulated, leaving Bonaparte free
to assume the offensive and advance, as he shortly did.
The British fleet had been forced to abandon Corsica and
the Mediterranean. Peace negotiations, begun with the
republic, had ended by the British envoy being peremptorily
ordered to leave France in forty-eight hours; and
although the government had not expected a favorable
issue, the effect on the people was disheartening. Consols
fell to 51, a depression greater than any reached during the
American Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The expedition of the French
against Ireland had indeed failed; but so little share had
the Channel fleet borne in their defeat, that the country
was forced to ascribe to the direct interposition of Divine
Providence a deliverance, which it would have preferred to
see wrought through the instrumentality of the navy. That
trusted arm of the national defence seemed palsied in every
quarter. Finally, among the greater of many discouraging
circumstances, specie payments were stopped by the
Bank of England on the 26th of February, in obedience to
an order of the government. The profuse subsidies paid to
continental states, and the demands for coin to meet the expenses
of the navy in all parts of the world, were the chief
causes of a drain against which the bank directors had frequently
remonstrated during two years as threatening ruin.
To these causes for scarcity was added at this time another,
temporary in its character and arising in great part from
loss of confidence in the navy's efficiency,—the fear, namely,
of invasion. People had begun to call for and to hoard coin
against an evil day. Such was the outlook as Jervis's captain
posted from Falmouth, where he landed, to London,
keeping the secret of his good news within his breast. The
frigate which had borne him went on to Plymouth with the
viceroy of Corsica, returning with his suite from his lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
principality. When they landed on the 5th of March,
news had just reached the town of the suspension of cash
payments, and, as they told of the great achievement off
Cape St. Vincent, people at first refused to believe that the
tide had turned. They were expecting to hear of a junction
between the French and Spanish fleets, and an approaching
invasion. So great was the financial panic, that
fifteen guineas were with difficulty collected among government
officials to pay the expenses of Elliott's journey to
London.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The revulsion was great, and was proved by the profusion
with which rewards were distributed. The Spanish
navy had been but a bugbear, but as a bugbear it was great.
The veil that covered its rottenness was stripped away, and
at the same time were revealed to the nation, which feared
it had no naval chiefs, the striking and brilliant figures of
Jervis and Nelson. In vain did the Opposition, in the true
spirit of faction, seek to turn men's eyes from the brilliant
achievements of the warriors to the imbecility affirmed of
the government, which had opposed fifteen ships to twenty-seven.
Thinking men realized that the administration
could not be held responsible for Mann's unauthorized return
at Christmas-tide, nor for the extraordinary series of
misfortunes by which five more of the Mediterranean fleet
were in one short month incapacitated. They saw, too,
that no popular government would have dared to replace
Mann's ships so long as the fate of Ireland, then in the
balance, was uncertain. But most men did not care to
think. It was enough for them that fifteen British ships
had dashed into the midst of twenty-seven enemies, had
collared and dragged out four of the biggest and severely
handled the rest. It was enough to hear that the crew of
one British seventy-four, headed by a man whom few out
of the navy yet knew, had, sword in hand, carried first a
Spanish eighty and then another of one hundred and twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
guns. With such men to rule the fleet, and with Pitt at the
helm of state, they thanked God and took courage. Speculation
is often futile; yet it is hard to see how the country
could have borne the approaching crisis of the mutinies,
on top of its other troubles, had not the fear of the Spanish
navy been removed and the hope of better naval leaders
been afforded. That the hope was well founded is no speculation.
With St. Vincent began a series of victories and
achievements which have thrown the great deeds of earlier
years into undeserved obscurity.</p>

<p>Immediately after the battle the Spanish fleet entered
Cadiz, and Jervis returned to Lisbon to refit his ships. On
the 31st of March, having received further re-enforcements,
he left Lisbon with twenty-one ships-of-the-line and took
position off Cadiz, where the Spaniards had twenty-six of
the same class. After cruising for six weeks under sail, he
anchored the fleet for a long blockade, and this disposition
continued with little intermission for two years,—until
May, 1799, when the successful sortie of Admiral Bruix
from Brest, related in another place,
<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and the consequent
chase by the British blockading force, gave the Spaniards
the opportunity to slip out. This tedious watching was unfruitful
in events of military interest; but the burden of
the commander-in-chief was increased by the spirit of
mutiny, rife throughout the whole period, which triumphed
temporarily in the Channel and North Sea fleets, and was
by Jervis kept down only by a stern vigilance of which few
but he were capable. Stamped out time and again by his
unflinching energy, it was continually renewed by the fresh
ships sent out from home, under officers of temper inferior
to his captains, and with seamen who knew not yet by experience
the indomitable will which they sought to bend.
Execution followed execution; but never once did the old
man's courage quail nor his determination falter. Seaman
and officer alike were made to feel that while his flag flew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
his authority should prevail; and with such backing the
officers showed themselves incapable of the weaknesses too
often manifested in the home ports.
<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> It is probable too that
a strong nucleus of support existed among the crews that
fought at St. Vincent,—due to admiration for the admiral
himself, and for Nelson, Collingwood, Troubridge, Saumarez
and others, who there distinguished themselves.</p>

<p>While these various events were transpiring at sea, from
the evacuation of Corsica to the battle of St. Vincent, Bonaparte
in Italy was still holding the line of the Adige and
blockading Mantua. His posture therefore was essentially
one of defence. The vigor and sagacity with which he resorted
to offensive movements the instant the enemy drew
down from the Tyrol to attack him, and the brilliant character
of the victories won by him, obscure to most the fact
that he was really on the defensive; holding on, amid risks
and discouragements, to the conquests already made, and
unable to attempt more until Mantua fell. The glories of
Castiglione, Arcola, Rivoli, conceal this crucial feature of
his situation, and the consequently important bearing of the
presence of the British fleet, encouraging the dispositions
of Naples and the Pope, which were distinctly hostile to the
French. Nothing less than Bonaparte's energy and genius
could have grappled successfully with such a situation; and
his correspondence betrays his fear that, by the co-operation
of the fleet, these dangers in the rear might become too
great even for him. When Mantua capitulated on the 2d
of February, Bonaparte turned first upon the Pope, whom
he accused of violating the armistice concluded the previous
June. His Holiness at once submitted, and on the 19th of
February signed a peace, abandoning his right to his
northern provinces,—Bologna, Ferrara and the Romagna,—and
ceding to France, until the end of the war, Ancona, a
good seaport on the Adriatic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 10th of March, having completed all the dispositions
that seemed necessary to secure his rear, Bonaparte
advanced against the Austrians. The young Archduke
Charles, whom the campaign of 1796 on the Danube had
revealed to Europe as gifted with military talents of a very
high order, had been sent to oppose him; but it was too
late to resist on the plains of Italy, or even on the Italian
side of the mountains. The French crossed the Tagliamento
on March 16, and pushed up through the gorges of
that stream and of the Isonzo into the eastern Alps. On
the 23d Trieste was occupied. The Archduke retired
continuously, barely disputing difficult positions with the
enemy. His mind was fixed not to fight until he had
drawn the French far into Germany, and had collected his
own resources,—a decision whose wisdom Bonaparte sealed
with his own commendation. "If the enemy had committed
the folly of awaiting me," he wrote to the Directory,
"I should have beaten them; but if they had continued to
fall back, had joined a part of their forces from the Rhine,
and had overwhelmed me, then retreat would have been
difficult, and the loss of the Army of Italy might entail that
of the republic. We must not shut our eyes to the fact
that, though our military position was brilliant, we have
not simply dictated the conditions."
<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Italy, too, was fermenting
behind him. The moral effect, however, of this
unopposed advance through the mountains of Carinthia
brought the House of Austria to terms; and on the 18th of
April preliminaries of peace were signed at Leoben, only
sixty miles from Vienna. Though the formal treaty was
not concluded until six months later, this transaction
marked, for that time, the end of hostilities between Austria
and France, which had then lasted five years,—from
April, 1792, to April, 1797.</p>

<p>The preliminaries of Leoben stipulated a mutual cessation
of hostilities between the republic and the emperor, and extended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
this provision to all the states of the German Empire,
as well as to the particular dominions of the emperor
himself. Austria surrendered definitively the Netherlands
(Belgium), and "recognized the limits of France as decreed
by the laws of the French Republic." In this phrase
was imbedded the rock upon which negotiations with Great
Britain split. The republic, on its part, undertook to furnish
to the emperor at the final peace a "just and suitable
compensation" for the provinces he lost.</p>

<p>The "suitable compensation," thus mysteriously alluded
to, was defined in the "secret preliminary agreements,"
contracted at the same moment. It was furnished by depriving
the republic of Venice, with which Bonaparte had
reasons for serious discontent, of all its possessions on the
mainland of Italy, as well as of Istria and Dalmatia on
the east coast of the Adriatic. The provinces thus taken
were divided: Austria receiving all east of the Oglio and
north of the Po, with Istria and Dalmatia. The country
between the Oglio and the Adda, previously owned by Venice,
was taken to constitute a new, independent republic;
into which were also incorporated all possessions of Austria
west of the Oglio conquered by the French in the recent
campaign. This was to be known as the Cisalpine Republic.
Thus the lords of the Adriatic were shorn of their
glory, and brought to the brink of the precipice from which,
six months later, at the final peace, the Corsican conqueror
hurled them headlong. For the moment there were spared
to them their ancient city and the Ionian Islands; and the
legations of Bologna, Ferrara, and the Romagna, taken from
the Pope, were given to them,—a like transient possession.</p>

<p>Such, in brief outline, were the principal terms of the
preliminaries of Leoben. The great and significant feature
does not ostensibly appear among the articles. Bonaparte,
in diplomacy, had achieved the great end at which
he aimed in his plans of campaign. He had separated his
enemies. "The French Republic," wrote he, "in granting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
at Leoben preliminaries so advantageous to his Imperial
Majesty, had as its principal end the conclusion of a <i>separate
peace</i> with his Majesty, in order to be in a position to
turn all its forces against England, and oblige her to a
prompt peace." He alone made and signed the preliminaries,
and this quotation gives the strategy and policy of his
life in a nutshell.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
The crucial fact at Leoben was that
Austria then, as Sardinia a year before, treated alone,—without
her ally. This Great Britain, to her honor, absolutely
refused to do in 1796, and as long as her ally stood
by her. There is, of course, a great difference between the
position of a state which finds a victorious enemy in the
heart of its territories, and that of an island empire; and
great allowance must be made for Austria, even though the
calm retrospect of history sees that she failed rightly to
appreciate the extreme hazard of Bonaparte's situation.
But this allowance merely emphasizes the important truth,
that the imposing attitude maintained by Great Britain
throughout this tremendous contest depended absolutely
and wholly upon the control of the sea,—upon Sea-Power.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="sc"><a name="NOTE2" id="NOTE2">Note.</a>.</span>—It now only remains to be seen how, when insubordination,
and accompanied by villany of this magnitude, did make its
open appearance, Lord St. Vincent dealt with it. A remarkable occasion
will be mentioned, not indeed the first outbreak of mutiny, nor
its last effort, but that one which excited the greatest sensation in the
fleet,—that which came with most untoward circumstances,—that of
which the enforcement of the penalty had, in Lord St. Vincent's opinion,
the most salutary effect.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>No sooner had Sir Roger Curtis arrived, than applications came to
the commander-in-chief for courts-martial on mutineers from three of
those ships,—the "Marlborough," the "Lion," and the "Centaur."
Selection will be made of the sequel to the "Marlborough."</p>

<p>As the squadron approached, and before the request for a court-martial,
this ship being known to the commander-in-chief to have
been among the most disorganized at Spithead had been ordered to
take her berth in the centre, at a small distance from the rest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
fleet. It, however, had so happened that a very violent mutiny in her
had broken out at Beerhaven, and again during the passage, which
had been suppressed by the officers, but chiefly by the first lieutenant.
The very object too of this mutiny was to protect the life of a seaman
who had forfeited it by a capital crime. A court-martial on the principal
mutineers was immediately assembled; and one was no sooner
sentenced to die than the commander-in-chief ordered him to be executed
on the following morning, "<i>and by the crew of the 'Marlborough'
alone, no part of the boats' crews from the other ships, as had been
usual on similar occasions, to assist in the punishment</i>,"—his Lordship's
invariable order on the execution of mutineers. On the receipt of the
necessary commands for this execution, the captain of the "Marlborough,"
Captain Ellison, waited upon the commander-in-chief, and reminding
his Lordship that a determination that their shipmates
should not suffer capital punishment had been the very cause of the
ship's company's mutiny, expressed his conviction that the "Marlborough's"
crew would never permit the man to be hanged on board
that ship.</p>

<p>Receiving the captain on the "Ville de Paris'" quarter-deck, before
the officers and ship's company, hearkening in breathless silence
to what passed, and standing with his hat in his hand over his head,
as was his Lordship's invariable custom during the whole time that
any person, whatever were his rank, even a common seaman, addressed
him on service, Lord St. Vincent listened very attentively till the
captain ceased to speak; and then, after a pause, replied,—</p>

<p>"What do you mean to tell me, Captain Ellison, that you cannot
<i>command</i> his Majesty's ship the 'Marlborough'? for if that is the
case, sir, I will immediately send on board an officer who can."</p>

<p>The captain then requested that, at all events, the boats' crews
from the rest of the fleet might, as always had been customary in the
service, on executions, attend at this also, to haul the man up; for he
really did not expect the "Marlborough's" would do it.</p>

<p>Lord St. Vincent sternly answered: "Captain Ellison, you are an
old officer, sir, have served long, suffered severely in the service, and
have lost an arm in action, and I should be very sorry that any advantage
should be now taken of your advanced years. That man
<i>shall be</i> hanged, at eight o'clock to-morrow morning, <i>and by his own
ship's company</i>: for not a hand from any other ship in the fleet shall
touch the rope. You will now return on board, sir; and, lest you
should not prove able to command your ship, an officer will be at
hand to you who can."</p>

<p>Without another word Captain Ellison instantly retired. After he
had reached his ship, he received orders to cause her guns to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
housed and secured, and that at daybreak in the morning her ports
should be lowered. A general order then issued to the fleet for all
launches to rendezvous under the "Prince" at seven o'clock on the
following morning, armed with carronades and twelve rounds of
ammunition for service; each launch to be commanded by a lieutenant,
having an expert and trusty gunners'-mate and four quarter-gunners,
exclusive of the launch's crew; the whole to be under the
command of Captain Campbell, of the "Blenheim." The written
orders to the captain will appear in their place. On presenting them,
Lord St. Vincent said, 'he was to attend the execution, and if any
symptoms of mutiny appeared in the "Marlborough," any attempt to
open her ports, or any resistance to the hanging of the prisoner, he
was to proceed close touching the ship, and to fire into her, and to
continue his fire until all mutiny or resistance should cease; and
that, should it become absolutely necessary, he should even sink the
ship in face of the fleet.'</p>

<p>Accordingly, at seven the next morning, all the launches, thus
armed, proceeded from the "Prince" to the "Blenheim," and thence,
Captain Campbell having assumed the command, to the "Marlborough."</p>

<p>Having lain on his oars a short time alongside, the captain then
formed his force in a line athwart her bows, at rather less than pistol-shot
distance off, and then he ordered the tompions to be taken out
of the carronades, and to load.</p>

<p>At half-past seven, the hands throughout the fleet having been
turned up to witness punishment, the eyes of all bent upon a powerfully
armed boat as it quitted the flag-ship; every one knowing that
there went the provost-marshal conducting his prisoner to the
"Marlborough" for execution. The crisis was come; now was to be
seen whether the "Marlborough's" crew would hang one of their own
men.</p>

<p>The ship being in the centre between the two lines of the fleet, the
boat was soon alongside, and the man was speedily placed on the cathead
and haltered. A few awful minutes of universal silence followed,
which was at last broken by the watch-bells of the fleet striking
eight o'clock. Instantly the flag-ship's gun fired, and at the sound
the man was lifted well off; but then, and visibly to all, he dropped
back again; and the sensation throughout the fleet was intense. For,
at this dreadful moment, when the eyes of every man in every ship
were straining upon this execution, as the decisive struggle between
authority and mutiny, as if it were destined that the whole fleet should
see the hesitating unwillingness of the "Marlborough's" crew to hang
their rebel, and the efficacy of the means taken to enforce obedience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
by an accident on board the ship the men at the yard-rope unintentionally
let it slip, and the turn of the balance seemed calamitously
lost; but then they hauled him up to the yard-arm with a run,—the
law was satisfied, and, said Lord St. Vincent at the moment, perhaps
one of the greatest of his life, "Discipline is preserved, sir!"</p>

<p>When the sentence was executed, and not any disturbance appeared,
that it might be again made perceptible to all the fleet that abundant
force had been provided to overpower any resistance which a line-of-battle
ship could offer, Captain Campbell broke his line, and rowing
down, placed his launches as close alongside the "Marlborough" as
their oars would permit; and then re-forming them, resumed his station
across her bows, continuing there until the time for the body's
hanging having expired, it was taken down, sewed up as is usual in
its own hammock with a shot, and was carried in one of the "Marlborough's"
boats to half a mile from the ship, and sunk; upon which,
Captain Campbell withdrew his force, and the "Marlborough's" signal
was made to take her station in the line.</p>

<p>This was the fatal blow to the mutiny in the fleet before Cadiz;
not that violent insubordination, treasonable conspiracies, and open
resistances did not again and again occur, to be as often and as instantaneously
quelled; for the ships were many that were sent out
from England, several arrived in almost open mutiny, and they
brought a profusion of infection to the rest. The dreadful sentence
was again and again inflicted, and in all cases of insubordination the
crews were invariably the executioners of their own rebels; but never
again was the power of the law doubted by any one.—<i>Tucker's Memoirs
of Earl St. Vincent</i>, vol. i. pp. 303-309.</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Preliminaries of Leoben silenced the strife of arms
and permitted all eyes to turn to the field of diplomacy,
upon which, for the twelve months following, the
interest of Europe was chiefly fixed. Moreau and Hoche,
commanding the two armies of France upon the Rhine, had
crossed the river, to enter upon a campaign in Germany, at
the very moment when Bonaparte was signing the articles.
On the 22d of April, a courier, bearing news of the suspension
of hostilities, arrived at the headquarters of each
general, and put an immediate stop to their advance.
War continued only upon the sea, between Great Britain
and the nations allied with France against her.</p>

<p>The confidence of the Directory had grown with each
successive victory of Bonaparte, and had induced a tone
in their transactions with foreign governments which the
latter looked upon as arrogant, if not presumptuous.
Yielding to politic considerations of effect upon popular
opinion, Pitt had sent to France, in October, 1796, a practised
diplomatist, Lord Malmesbury, to treat for peace. The
terms proposed by Great Britain were substantially a restitution
of conquests on both sides. If France would give
back to the emperor the Netherlands and Lombardy, Great
Britain, who had lost nothing of her own, would return to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
France her possessions in the East and West Indies, as
well as in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with the <i>status ante
bellum</i> of the fisheries. As regards the colonies taken from
Holland, the disposition would be to restore them, if the
government of the stadtholder were replaced; but if the
republic set up by the assistance of French arms were
maintained, Great Britain and the emperor, from whom the
former refused to dissociate herself, would insist upon indemnification
elsewhere for the injury thus done to their
political position in Europe. With these understandings as
a basis, the British government would be willing to enter
upon negotiations for a general peace; to which it expressly
required that Russia and Portugal, as well as the emperor,
should be admitted. The French government replied that
Great Britain had no authority to speak here for her allies;
and further, that to cede territory which had been incorporated
by the edicts of the Convention, as the Netherlands
had, was inconsistent with the organic law of the republic.
This latter plea was treated by the British government as trifling;
no negotiation to close a war could go on, if results,
favorable to one party, were secluded from discussion by
the <i>ægis</i> of its constitution. As the case stood, France and
Great Britain were both conquerors; the chief allies of each
were losers. Great Britain proposed that each should surrender
its winnings for the benefit of its allies. France
refused, because its conquests were now part of the national
territory, and as such inalienable. Taking exception,
moreover, to delays caused by Malmesbury's frequent references
to his government for instructions, the Directory, on
the 20th of December, ordered him to leave Paris, within
the not very civil space of forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>Similar cavalier treatment was at the same time experienced
by the United States. Our government, after the
maritime war began, had frequent disputes with both belligerents,—concerning
the treatment of American ships by
the British and French cruisers,—the protection of enemies'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
goods by the neutral flag,—the stipulations of Jay's treaty
of commerce and navigation, in 1794, regarded by France
as unduly favorable to Great Britain,—and the attitude of
the United States towards French privateers, which were at
first allowed and afterwards forbidden to sell prizes in her
ports. These difficulties were fundamentally due to the
fact that, the United States having practically no navy,
neither belligerent felt under any bonds to respect her
rights. To Great Britain, however, friendly relations were
important on account of trade interests; while France,
having no merchant ships, found an advantage in using
Americans as carriers, and their ports as bases from which
her cruisers could harass British commerce. The former
of these benefits Great Britain curtailed by the claim that
enemy's goods were, by international law, seizable under a
neutral flag. The United States admitted this, and also,
in the interests of her own peace and neutrality, declined
longer to favor French commerce-destroying. Mutual discontent
followed, and resulted in the recall of the French
embassy from America, in November, 1796. At the same
time President Washington, being dissatisfied with Munroe,
the minister at Paris, removed him. When the latter, on
the 30th of December, took his leave, the President of the
Directory made a speech, highly complimentary to him
personally, but offensive to the United States government;
and evinced, as President Adams justly said, "a disposition
to separate the people of the United States from the government,
and thus to produce divisions fatal to our peace."
The same theory of the divergent interests of rulers and
people, with which the French republic started on its self-imposed
mission forcibly to regenerate ancient despotisms,
was thus impartially applied to the free American people
under the government of their chosen and beloved fellow-citizen,
Washington. The Directory refused to receive
Pinckney, the new envoy from the United States. He
remained in Paris, unrecognized, for a month; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
morning after hearing of the victory of Rivoli, the Directory
ordered him to leave France.</p>

<p>By a somewhat singular coincidence, while the republic
was thus embroiling itself with the two chief maritime
states, a change of rulers took place in Russia; which, if
not strictly a maritime power, was yet well placed, through
her preponderance on the Baltic, to affect the naval interests
of the world. The Empress Catherine II. died on the
17th of November, 1796, when about to conclude an agreement
with the courts of London and Vienna to abandon
her rather passive attitude of hostility towards France, and
send an army of sixty thousand men to the support of
Austria. Her successor, Paul I., allowed this treaty to drop,
and resumed a bearing of cold watchfulness, until Bonaparte,
by the seizure of Malta, and the Directory by a threat
of war if commerce were permitted between his empire and
Great Britain, drove his half-insane temper into open hostilities.
But this was a year later.</p>

<p>These events at the end of 1796 coincided in time with
the close alliance of the republic with Spain and Holland
and its formal treaties of peace with the Italian states. By
these and by the preliminaries of Leoben were defined the
external relations of France in April, 1797. At the same
moment her internal condition became alarming. The time
had come to choose new members to replace one third of
each body of the legislature; and the elections, still influenced
by the memory of the Terror, resulted in the
return of so many reactionaries as to give these a majority
in both houses, especially in the lower. The latter at once
showed its spirit by electing for speaker, by a large majority,
General Pichegru, who was in open quarrel with the
Directory; and followed up this significant act by a series of
measures calculated to thwart the executive power and enfeeble
its action. The opposition between the legislature
and the Directory grew more and more pronounced throughout
the summer months; but the reactionists failed to read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
aright the signs of the times. They allowed themselves, by
the machinations of the royalists and through injudicious
acts of their own, to seem enemies of republican government,
which aroused the anxiety of Hoche, commanding
the army of the Sambre and Meuse; and they directly
brought into question the conduct of Bonaparte towards
Venice, thus stirring up the more personal and violent
enmity of the brilliant conqueror of Italy. The legislature
thus found itself opposed by the two generals who stood
highest in public esteem as essential to the safety of France,
and who, each according to his own nature, transmitted his
feelings to the troops under his command, and prepared
them for a <i>coup d'état</i>. Inflammatory speeches and toasts
prevailed throughout the armies, to which the republic was
dear rather as a name than as a reality, and they were
easily led to think that the two houses were contemplating
a return to royalty.</p>

<p>The majority of the Directory, half-believing the same
thing, and chafed by an opposition which seriously hampered
the working of the government, were ready for violent
measures. Two of its members, however, were not prepared
for such action; and one of these, Carnot, the
organizer of the republic's early victories, was then serving
his turn as president of the Directory. Unknown to him
the three plotters matured their scheme, and called upon
Bonaparte to send them Augereau, the most revolutionary
of the generals in Italy, to direct the troops in such forcible
proceedings as might be necessary. Upon his arrival he
was made commandant of the military division of Paris,
despite the opposition of Carnot. The latter's presidency
expired on the 24th of August, and he was succeeded by
one of the conspirators. On the night of September 3d Augereau
surrounded the castle and garden of the Tuileries with
twelve thousand troops and forty cannon, driving out the
legislators who were then there, together with their guard.
The Directory ordered the arrest, by its own guard, of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
members not in the plot. Carnot escaped into Switzerland;
but Barthélemi, their other colleague, was seized. The
next day the members of the two houses who had not been
imprisoned met and passed a resolution, invalidating a number
of the recent elections, and exiling to Cayenne the two
directors and fifty-three representatives. The legislature,
thus purged, was brought into harmony with the executive.
An address was next issued to the departments and to the
armies, declaring that the country had been invaded and
disorganized by the Counter-Revolution and that patriotism,
with the social and public virtues, had taken refuge with
the armies. "In this," says a republican historian, "there
was unhappily some truth. The middle class had become
reactionary or inert; the populace now intervened but little
in political movements; active democracy scarcely showed
itself out of the armies. But if armies can defend liberty,
they cannot put it in practice and maintain its life when
abandoned by civil society. The revolution just effected
with the consent of the soldiery was leading to another
revolution to be effected by and for the soldiers."
<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The
18th of Fructidor, 1797, was the logical forerunner of the
18th of Brumaire, 1799, when Bonaparte seized the reins
of government.</p>

<p>The strife between the Directory and the legislature kept
all Europe in suspense; for its result would profoundly
affect the course of existing discussions. The emperor, repenting
of his precipitation at Leoben, kept holding off from
a final treaty, seeking to introduce Great Britain as a party
to the deliberations. This Bonaparte indignantly refused;
for it would defeat his principal aim of separate negotiations.
Pitt, more desirous than before of peace, again sent
Malmesbury. The Directory kept him dancing attendance
at Lille, the appointed place of meeting, during its struggle
with the Councils. It made several demands most unlikely
to be conceded, and upon these prolonged a discussion, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
which the ministry, who now really wished a favorable termination,
patiently submitted. A week after the <i>coup
d'état</i> the French negotiators were recalled, and in their
place were sent others, who immediately upon arrival demanded
of the British ambassador whether he had "powers
to restore to France and its allies <i>all</i> the possessions which
since the beginning of the war have passed into the hands of
the English." An answer was required in the course of the
same day. Malmesbury coolly replied that he neither could,
nor ought to, treat on any other principle than that of compensations.
The French envoys then sent him orders from
the Directory to return within twenty-four hours to his
Court and get powers to make those restorations. This, of
course, put an end to the conference, and the war went on
for four years more.</p>

<p>During these eventful months Bonaparte, already the
most influential man in the nation through his hold upon
men's imaginations, was ripening projects deeply affecting
the control of the sea and the future direction to be given
the gigantic efforts of which France had shown herself
capable. On the 5th of April, under his management,
there had been concluded with the king of Sardinia, subject
to ratification by the Directory, a treaty of offensive
and defensive alliance, to which was prefixed a secret article
ceding to France the island of Sardinia upon condition
of compensation on the continent.
<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Soon after, however,
events occurred which opened to his penetrating genius a
more satisfactory combination. During his invasion of
Carinthia the people in his rear, throughout the possessions
of Venice on the Italian mainland, rose against the French,
massacring several hundred soldiers who fell into their
hands. This gave him a pretext for disposing of these
territories, as already stated,
<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> in the secret articles of
Leoben, and at the same time drew from him the sinister
prediction that the government of Venice, shut up to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
small island, would not be of long duration.
<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> On the 2d
of May, having returned to Italy, he issued a proclamation,
<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
setting forth his many causes of complaint for the
commotions excited in his rear, endangering the army
"then plunged in the gorges of Styria." He ordered the
French minister to leave Venice, all Venetian agents to
quit Lombardy and the Venetian possessions, and the
French general to treat the troops of the republic as
enemies, and to tear down her standard throughout the
mainland.</p>

<p>This declaration of war was followed, on the 16th of
May, by the abdication of the ancient oligarchy in favor of
a provisional government, which requested the presence
of a French division in the city to maintain order during
the transition period. This Bonaparte granted, sending
five thousand men, and observing cynically in his despatch
to the Directory that it would thus be possible to avoid the
odium attendant upon the execution of the secret preliminaries
with Austria, and at the same time to quiet the
clamors of Europe; since "it is apparent that the occupation
is only temporary and at the demand of the Venetians
themselves."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
Ten days later he despatched General Gentili,
recalled from Corsica, to Corfu with some two thousand
troops, directing him to secure his hold both upon
the islands and the Venetian squadron lying there, but always
to act as though supporting the Venetian commissioners
who were to accompany him. "If the islanders
incline to independence," wrote he, "flatter them, and talk
about Greece, Athens, and Sparta."
<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> To the Venetian
government he wrote that the expedition was sent to second
its commissioners; and on the same day to the Directory,
that Corfu ought to be irrevocably possessed by the
French. "The island of Malta," he added, "is of the utmost
importance to us.... Why should not our fleet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
seize it before entering the Atlantic? That little island is
priceless to us. Secret articles with the king of Sardinia
stipulate for us the occupation of the little islands of San
Pietro. Now is the moment to fortify them;"
<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> for the British
Mediterranean fleet was before Cadiz, and the Channel
fleet in full mutiny.</p>

<p>Four months later Bonaparte again wrote, "With San
Pietro, Corfu, and Malta, we shall be masters of the whole
Mediterranean."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
"The islands of Corfu, Zante, and
Cephalonia are of more consequence to us than all Italy.
If we had to choose, better restore Italy to the emperor
and keep the four islands.... The empire of the Turks
crumbles daily. The possession of the four islands will
enable us to sustain it, or to take our share. The time is
not far distant when we shall feel that, truly to destroy
England, we must take possession of Egypt. The vast
Ottoman Empire, which is perishing daily, puts on us the
obligation to take means for the preservation of our Levant
trade."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
"If at the peace we have to consent to the cession
of the Cape of Good Hope to England, we should
seize Egypt. That country has never belonged to a European
nation. It does not now belong to the Grand Turk.
We could leave here with twenty-five thousand men, convoyed
by eight or ten ships-of-the-line, and take possession
of it. I wish you would inquire, Citizen Minister, what
effect upon the Porte would result from our expedition to
Egypt."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
"Our occupation of Corfu and the other islands
entails relations with the pashas of Albania. These are
well affected to the French. In vain should we seek to
sustain the Turkish Empire; we shall see its fall in our
day. Corfu and Zante give us mastery of the Adriatic
and the Levant."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
In these quotations, which could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
multiplied, is seen the genesis of the great Egyptian expedition,
to which, until it was carried into effect, Bonaparte
recurred again and again with the persistency characteristic
of his conceptions.</p>

<p>While he was thus employed, on the one hand flattering
Venice with the hope of continued national existence, and
on the other treating with Austria for her extinction and
a division of the spoil, in which France was to have the
Ionian Islands and the Venetian navy,
<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>—while Malmesbury
was negotiating at Lille, and the Directory was in
bitter conflict with the Councils,—there was painfully sailing
for England, crippled and suffering, the man who was
destined to dispel the gorgeous dreams of Eastern achievement
which filled Bonaparte's brain, and to shatter the
French navy,—the all-essential link which alone could knit
together these diverse maritime possessions, the one foundation
upon which stood the whole projected fabric of Mediterranean
control. During the wearing times of the Cadiz
blockade, Lord St. Vincent, aware how much the listlessness
of such inactive service contributed to foment mutiny,
endeavored ingeniously to contrive fighting to occupy the
minds of the seamen. For that purpose, largely, he bombarded
Cadiz; and for that purpose he sent Nelson, with a
detached squadron, to seize the town of Santa Cruz in the
Canary Islands by a sudden and vigorous assault, hoping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
also there to take the rich cargo of a galleon, laden on
account of the Court of Spain. The attack was made on
the night of July 24, with all the vigor to be expected of
Nelson, but under great disadvantage. It resulted in a
disastrous repulse with heavy loss; and the admiral himself
suffered amputation of the right arm. It became necessary
for him to go to England, where he remained
through a long and painful convalescence until the following
April; when he again sailed to join the Mediterranean
fleet, arriving just in time to command the squadron sent
in pursuit of Bonaparte.</p>

<p>The dissensions which weakened the external action of
the French government having been silenced by the <i>coup
d'état</i> of September 4, Bonaparte rapidly drew to an end
the negotiations with Austria. On the 17th of October,
1797, he, as sole representative of France, signed the treaty
of Campo Formio; which followed the general lines of the
Leoben preliminaries, yet with important differences. The
dissimulation concerning Venice was thrown aside, and
the ancient state wholly disappeared. The city, with the
mainland as far as the Adige, were given to Austria.
West of the Adige, the old Venetian provinces went to the
Cisalpine Republic, which was also dowered with the papal
legations attributed for a brief moment to Venice. The
countries and islands east of the Adriatic which had belonged
to her were divided at the Gulf of Drino. All inside
that point went to Austria; all outside, to France, which
thus became possessed of the desire of Bonaparte's heart,
Corfu and its sister islands, with some slight territory on
the adjacent mainland. The cession of the Netherlands to
France was confirmed, and provision was made for a Congress
to be held at Rastadt for the pacification and rearrangement
of the German Empire; for Bonaparte had
persisted in treating with the emperor on account only of
his own dominions, and apart from the rest of the empire.
By secret stipulations, the two great powers agreed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
support each other's demands and interests in the Congress;
where France wished to secure a certain line of the
Rhine, and Austria to indemnify herself, at the expense of
some German minor states, for the losses undergone by
the treaty.</p>

<p>The salient features of this treaty were therefore the
cession of Belgium; the annihilation of Venice; the settlement
of the Cisalpine Republic as a powerful dependency
of France; the strengthening of the latter as a Mediterranean
state by the gain of the Ionian Islands; and, finally,
the loosing of her hands against Great Britain, which now
stood without a strong ally in all Europe. Bonaparte justified
his action to his critics on these grounds, but especially
on account of the necessity of dealing with Great Britain
single-handed. "When the Cisalpine has the best military
frontier in Europe, when France gains Mayence and the
Rhine, when she has in the Levant Corfu, extremely well
fortified, and the islands, what more would you wish? To
scatter our force, in order that England may continue to
take from us, from Spain, from Holland, our colonies, and
postpone yet further the restoration of our trade and our
navy?... Either our government must destroy the English
monarchy, or must expect itself to be destroyed by the
corruption and intrigue of those active islanders. The
present moment offers us a fine game. Let us concentrate
all our activity upon the navy, and destroy England. That
done, Europe is at our feet."
<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Thus did Bonaparte demonstrate
that the scene of strife was to be transferred to the
sea.</p>

<p>The Directory at once ratified the Treaty of Campo
Formio, and named Bonaparte one of three plenipotentiaries
to the Congress of Rastadt. The general remained in Italy
for a month longer, organizing the new state, and distributing
the army with a view to support the interests of France,
while withdrawing some thirty thousand men for the intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
army of England. On the 17th of November he left
Milan, and on the 25th arrived at Rastadt. He remained
there, however, but a week; and then, apparently at the
call of the Directory,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
started for Paris, which he reached
on the 5th of December. He was avowedly to command the
army of England, and during the two following months his
correspondence betrays no sign of any other purpose; his
orders to various subordinates, and especially to Berthier,
his celebrated chief-of-staff, at the time commanding in
Italy, abound with dispositions and instructions to transfer
troops thence towards the Channel. Particularly significant
of such intention were the orders sent from him to Admiral
Brueys, commanding the French division in Corfu, to start
for Brest,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
—a mission which would make his force inaccessible
for the Egyptian expedition. Too much stress, however,
cannot be laid upon such indications coming from so
crafty a nature; and the first intimation of a change of
purpose has more the appearance of stripping off a mask
than of awakening from a dream. "Make what efforts we
will," wrote he to the Directory, on February 23, 1798,
"we shall not for many years acquire the control of the
seas. To make a descent upon England, without being
master of the sea, is the boldest and most difficult operation
ever attempted."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
Most true, but not new. Nor was the
veil under which he covered his change of attitude very
difficult to pierce. On the 7th of February, 1798, he wrote
to the Minister of War that he was about to visit the Channel
coast, near Dunkirk, sending Kleber and Desaix to
Havre and Brest. On the 12th from Dunkirk he sends
engineers to examine Boulogne, Etaples, Ambleteuse, and
Calais,—ports on which he, five years later, based his more
serious projects of invasion; and at the same time two
others are dispatched to Holland to demand help of various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
kinds. The very next day, February 13, he sends orders to
Toulon, in the name of the Directory, not only to hold on
to the ships ordered for Brest, but to send despatch vessels
in every direction to recall to Toulon all ships-of-war
cruising in the Mediterranean.
<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Returning to Paris, he
addressed a letter to the government, setting forth what
needed to be done by the month of April in order to make
the attempt upon Great Britain even possible,—a long
array of requirements, which only he, if his heart were in
the matter, was capable of accomplishing. He concluded
by saying there were but three ways of reaching England.
One was by direct invasion; the second, by an attempt
upon Hanover and Hamburg,—the continental centres of
her trade; the last, by an expedition to the Levant.</p>

<p>On the 5th of March Bonaparte communicated to the
government a note containing the dispositions necessary
for an expedition to seize Egypt and Malta. The same day
the Directory issued a number of decrees, constituting a
commission on the Coast Defences of the Mediterranean,
under cover of which the needed preparations were to be
carried on, and defining the various steps to be taken. The
ships at Toulon were required to be ready for sea on the 4th
of April. Admiral Brueys, who had been unable to sail for
Brest on account of want of provisions, was on February
12 ordered to Toulon. He arrived there with, his squadron
on the 2d of April, and was appointed to command
the naval part of the expedition, to consist of thirteen ships-of-the-line
with smaller vessels. All arrangements were
pushed with the greatest activity possible, though much
retarded by the extreme want of naval stores, of provisions,
and of money. Still greater difficulty was experienced
from scarcity of sailors; the inducements offered by privateers
having drawn away almost all the seamen of the
republic, and landed great numbers of them in British
prisons,—a sad result of the much-vaunted commerce-destroying.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Through all, the pretence of invading England
was maintained; and Bonaparte himself, to mislead opinion,
stayed till the last moment in Paris. The Spanish fleet at
Cadiz was, by the urgent demands of the Directory, made
to assume positions which threatened an approaching departure,
in order to fasten St. Vincent's ships to the port
and foster in British minds the easily aroused fear of an
invasion of Ireland. But measures so extensive could not
long escape comment and suspicion. The actual intentions
of the Directory were kept so impenetrably secret that,
after the expedition sailed, the senior naval officer at Toulon
wrote to the Minister of Marine, "I know no more of
the movements of the squadron than if it did not belong to
the republic;"<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
but it was not possible to conceal the patent
fact that Marseille, Toulon, Genoa, Civita Vecchia, and
Corsica were alive with hurried preparations for a great
naval undertaking, whatever its destination might be. It
was evident, therefore, that France was about to expose
herself for a time upon the sea to the blows of Great Britain,
and the ministry determined not to let such an opportunity
slip.</p>

<p>During the year 1797 no British fleet, and, with the rare
exception of one or two scattered cruisers, no British ship-of-war,
had entered the Mediterranean. The gathering of
the Spanish navy at Cadiz, and of the greater part of the
French in Brest, with the apparent design to invade Ireland
or England, had dictated the concentration of the British
navy before those two ports; either immediately, as St.
Vincent at Cadiz, or by the dispositions—less fitted to
compass their purpose—of the Channel fleet, by which
bodies of ships were gathered at points other than Brest,
with the hope of combining them against any sortie from
that port. Great Britain, during the time following St.
Vincent's retreat from the Mediterranean, was in the position
of a nation struggling for existence,—for so she felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
it,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
—which had been compelled to contract her lines
through loss of force, due to the gradual submission of her
allies to her enemies. To this had further conduced the
threatening attitude of the Dutch navy in the Texel, requiring
a strong North Sea fleet. To her other embarrassments
had been added, in this year of distress, the extensive
mutinies in the navy. Though appeased in some instances
and quelled in others, the spirit which caused them still
existed. Under these circumstances Bonaparte, in 1797,
had met no naval obstacle to his plans for the control of the
Mediterranean, which had, moreover, been so covert as to
escape detection. Admiral Brueys had gone from Toulon
to the Adriatic, remained there several months, and returned
in peace; and all minor naval movements went on undisturbed.
The destiny of Corfu was not revealed till the end
of the year; the purpose to get hold of Malta, seriously
entertained by Brueys at the instigation of Bonaparte,
<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
never transpired; and the talk about the army of England
combined with the actual positions of the allied fleets to
retain the British in the same stations. Toward the end
of 1797 several circumstances occurred to relieve the pressure.
In October Admiral Duncan inflicted upon the
Dutch fleet, off the Texel, a defeat so decisive and complete
as to throw it out of the contest for a long time. Of
fifteen ships opposed to him, nine were taken. The condition
of the French fleet in Brest, if not accurately known
to be as bad as Bonaparte represented it,
<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> was still sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
understood. No attempt had been made during the
summer or winter of 1797 to renew the Irish expedition;
and when the opening spring of 1798 permitted the Channel
fleet in a body to keep the sea, the ministry felt it safe
to detach a force to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Sir Horatio Nelson sailed from England on the 10th of
April, and joined the fleet off Cadiz on the 30th. Lord St.
Vincent welcomed him gladly, and at once sent him with
three ships-of-the-line to the Mediterranean, to watch the
impending armament, and, if possible, learn its destination.
Nelson left the fleet on the 2d of May, the day before
Bonaparte quitted Paris. On the 17th, having been unavoidably
delayed at Gibraltar, he was in the neighborhood
of Toulon, and captured a French corvette just leaving port;
from which he learned particulars as to the naval force of
the enemy, but nothing as regarded its destination. On the
night of the 20th, in a violent gale of wind, his own ship
was dismasted and with difficulty saved from going ashore.
By great exertions she was towed by her consorts into the
San Pietro Islands, at the south end of Sardinia, where she
anchored on the 23d. On the 19th Bonaparte had sailed
with the Marseille and Toulon divisions of the expedition.
He was to be joined on the way by the detachments from
Genoa, Corsica, and Civita Vecchia,—the total number of
troops amounting to between thirty and thirty-five
thousand.</p>

<p>On the same day that Nelson parted from St. Vincent,
May 2, the admiralty wrote to the latter that it was
essential to send twelve ships-of-the-line into the Mediterranean
to counteract the French armament; and that to
replace them eight ships had been ordered from England.
A private letter from the First Lord, by the same mail,
authorized St. Vincent to take his whole force for this
object, if necessary, but hoped a detachment would be sufficient.
In the latter case, while the choice of its commander
was left to the admiral, it was intimated that Nelson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
though junior to two other flag-officers, was by all means
the proper man. Jervis had already made the same decision;
and now at once told off and prepared the nine ships-of-the-line,
forming the inshore squadron of the blockade,
to start the moment the expected re-enforcement arrived.
The junction of the latter with the main fleet was made
May 24, out of sight of the port; and during the night
Captain Troubridge sailed with the inshore ships, their
places being taken by vessels similarly painted, so that no
suspicion of the transaction might arise in Cadiz. On the
7th of June Troubridge joined Nelson, having picked up
two more ships by the way; so that the British were now
thirteen seventy-fours and one of fifty guns. By a very
strange fatality, however, the frigates at first with Nelson
had parted company the night his ship was dismasted, and
had never rejoined. Troubridge brought only one little brig;
and, as it was inadmissible to scatter the ships-of-the-line,
the want of lookout vessels seriously affected all Nelson's
movements in the long and harassing pursuit, covering
nearly eight weeks, that lay before him.</p>

</div>

<p>After leaving Toulon, Bonaparte directed his force along
the Gulf of Genoa, where, on the night of May 20, he experienced
the same gale that dismasted Nelson. The
next day the convoy from Genoa joined. Steering south
along the east coasts of Corsica and Sardinia, the division
from Corsica met him on the 26th off the south end of the
island, but that from Civita Vecchia failed to appear.
Here the French first heard that Nelson was in the
Mediterranean with three ships, and expected ten more.
Bonaparte then continued on for Malta, which he reached
on the 9th of June, and found there the division from
Civita Vecchia, thus bringing his whole force under his
hand. The island was immediately summoned, and after a
faint show of resistance capitulated on the 12th; the French
fleet and convoy, numbering four hundred sail, entering the
port of La Valetta on the 13th. Bonaparte remained the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
time necessary to secure his conquest temporarily; then
leaving a garrison of four thousand men, and notifying the
Directory that at least four thousand more with ample supplies
were needed, he sailed again on June 19 for Egypt.</p>

<p>The British fleet, after its junction, was becalmed for
several days. It then made the best of its way round the
north end of Corsica, and thence south between Italy and the
islands. Not till June 14, off Civita Vecchia, was probable
information received that the French had been seen ten
days before off the south-west point of Sicily, steering to
the eastward. As yet there was no certainty as to their
destination, and Nelson had no light vessels for scouts. St.
Vincent in his instructions had said, reflecting the ideas of
the government, that the enemy's "object appears to be
either an attack upon Naples or Sicily, the conveyance of an
army to some part of Spain to invade Portugal, or to pass
through the Straits with the view of proceeding to Ireland."
The whole situation vividly illustrates the difficulty of pursuit
by sea, and the necessity of stationing and keeping the
detaining force near the point of the enemy's departure before
he can get away. By whatsoever fault, certainly not
that of Nelson or St. Vincent, the British fleet was a fortnight
too late in entering the Mediterranean. It would
have been yet more so, had the resources of the French
dockyards answered to the spur of Bonaparte's urgency;
but it is ill goading a starved horse.</p>

<p>An easterly course, however, with a fresh north-west
wind, indicated that neither Spain nor the Atlantic was the
destination of the French armament; and Nelson at once
decided it must be Malta, to be used as a base of operations
against Sicily. "Were I," said he, "the admiral of the fleet
attending an army for the invasion of Sicily, I should say
to the general: 'If you can take Malta, it secures the safety
of the fleet and the transports, and your own safe retreat, if
necessary;' <i>Malta is in the direct road to Sicily</i>."
<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Pausing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
a moment to communicate with Naples, he there heard, on
the 17th of June, that the French had landed at Malta;
and pushing on, received off Messina the news of its surrender.
This was on the 20th, the day after Bonaparte
sailed from the island for Egypt. On the 22d, off Cape
Passaro, the south-east extremity of Sicily, a vessel was
spoken, from which Nelson gained the information of Bonaparte's
departure, supposed to be for Sicily; but he had
meantime learned from Naples that the French had no intention
of molesting any part of that kingdom. Utterly in
the dark, and without frigates, he concluded, after weighing
all the chances, that Egypt was the enemy's destination,
and with a fair wind and a press of sail shaped his course
for Alexandria. On the 28th the fleet came off the port,
and sent a boat ashore. No French vessels had been seen
on the coast.</p>

<p>This remarkable miscarriage, happening to a man of so
much energy and intuition, was due primarily to his want
of small lookout ships; and secondly, to Bonaparte's using
the simple, yet at sea sufficient, ruse
<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> of taking an indirect
instead of a direct course to his object. This, however, in
a narrow sea, with so numerous a body of vessels, would
not have served him, had the British admiral had those
active purveyors of information, those eyes of the fleet,
which are so essential to naval as to land warfare.
<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> On
leaving Malta, Bonaparte directed the expedition to steer
first for Candia. After a week's quiet navigation he was
off the south side of the island, and on the 27th of June
was joined by a frigate from Naples, to tell him of Nelson,
with fourteen sail, being off that port ten days before. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
this moment the British admiral had already outstripped
his chase. On the 25th the two fleets had been about
sixty miles apart, the French due north of the British,
steering in nearly parallel directions.
<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> When Bonaparte
knew that his enemy was somewhere near upon his heels,
he again changed the course, ordering the fleet to make
the land seventy miles west of Alexandria, and sending a
frigate direct to the port to reconnoitre. On the 29th of
June, the day Nelson sailed away from Alexandria, the
light squadron signalled the coast, along which the fleet
sailed till July 1st, when it anchored off the city. Determined
to run no chance of an enemy's frustrating his objects,
the commander-in-chief landed his army the same
evening.</p>

<p>If, in this celebrated chase, Nelson made a serious mistake,
it was upon his arrival at Alexandria. He had reasoned
carefully, and, as the event proved, accurately, that
the French were bound to Egypt; and had justly realized
the threat to the British supremacy in India contained in
such an attempt. Knowing the time when the French left
Malta, as he did, and that they were accompanied by so
great a train of transports, it seems a fair criticism that
he should have trusted his judgment a little further, and
waited off the suspected port of destination to see whether
so cumbrous a body had not been outsailed by his compact,
homogeneous force. He appears, on finding his expectations
deceived, to have fallen into a frame of mind familiar
to most, in which a false step, however imposed by the
conditions under which it was taken, can be seen only in
the light of the unfortunate consequences, and therein assumes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the color of a fault, or at best of a blunder. "His
active and anxious mind," wrote Sir Edward Berry, who,
as captain of the flag-ship, was witness of his daily feelings,
"would not permit him to rest a moment in the same
place; he therefore shaped his course to the northward
for the coast of Caramania."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> His one thought now was
to get back to the westward, taking a more northerly
course on the return, so as to increase the chance of information.
The fleet accordingly stretched to the northward
until the coast of Asia Minor was made, and then
beat back along the south shore of Candia, not seeing a
single vessel until it had passed that island. On the 19th
of July it reached Syracuse, whence Nelson wrote to the
British minister at Naples that, having gone a round of six
hundred leagues with the utmost expedition, he was as
ignorant of the situation of the enemy as he had been four
weeks before. The squadron now filled with water, which
was running short, and on the 24th again sailed for Alexandria;
the admiral having satisfied himself that the
French were at least neither in Corfu nor to the westward.
On the 1st of August the minarets of the city were seen,
and soon after the port full of shipping, with the French
flag upon the walls, but, to Nelson's bitter disappointment,
no large ships of war. At one in the afternoon, however,
one of his fleet made signal that a number of ships-of-the-line
were at anchor in Aboukir Bay, twelve or fifteen miles
east of Alexandria; and Nelson, prompt to attack as Bonaparte
had been to disembark, gave slippery fortune, so
long unkind, no chance again to balk him, but with a
brisk breeze flew at once upon the foe.</p>

<p>Neither by the character of the anchorage nor by its
own dispositions was the French fleet prepared for the
attack thus suddenly, and most unexpectedly, precipitated
upon it. Two days after the army landed, the commander-in-chief
gave Admiral Brueys explicit and urgent orders at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
once to sound the old port of Alexandria, and, if possible,
take his ships in there; if not, and if Aboukir Bay would
admit of defence at anchor against a superior force, he
might choose a position there. Failing both, he was to go
with his heavy vessels to Corfu.
<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> That and the other
Ionian Islands were within Bonaparte's district, by the
decree of April 12 making him commander of the Army
of the East. In a much later dispatch, which Brueys
did not live to receive, he explains that it was indispensable
to preserve the fleet from serious injury until
the affair in Egypt was settled, in order to check any
movement of the Porte; for, though the allegiance of
the Mamelukes was but nominal, it was possible the Sultan
might resent the French invasion. The justice of this
cautious view was shown by the action of the Porte as soon
as the destruction of the fleet became known. Brueys ordered
the necessary soundings, and the report which he
received on July 18, a fortnight before the battle, was favorable;
with good weather it was possible to take the
ships-of-the-line inside.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The admiral, however, was an
invalid, and of a temper naturally undecided; unable to
make a choice of difficulties, he hung on the balance and
remained inactive, taking refuge in a persuasion that the
British would not return. Bonaparte thought the same.
"All the conduct of the English," wrote he on the 30th of
July, "indicates that they are inferior in number, and content
themselves with blockading Malta and intercepting its
supplies." But the great soldier, prone as he always was
to tempt fortune to the utmost for a great object, found in
this opinion no reason for running unnecessary risks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
in the same breath insisted upon Alexandria or Corfu for
the fleet. Brueys had taken his ships to Aboukir Bay on
the 8th of July, and there remained. He had the orders of
his commander; but the latter, at a distance and absorbed
in the cares of his operations ashore, could not communicate
to his vacillating subordinate the impulse of his own
energy. All the work of the squadron proceeded listlessly;
the belief that the British fleet would not return sapped
every effort; carelessness, indiscipline and insubordination,
among officers and men, caused constant complaint
and trouble. In such delusion and lethargy went by the
priceless days which were passed by Nelson in unresting
thought and movement, in "a fever of anxiety"
<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> that
scarcely allowed him to eat or drink.</p>

<p>The Bay of Aboukir,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> in the western portion of which
the French fleet was anchored, and where was fought the
celebrated Battle of the Nile, is an open roadstead, extending
from the promontory of Aboukir, fifteen miles east of
Alexandria, to the Rosetta mouth of the Nile. The distance
between the two extreme points is about eighteen
miles. In the western part, where the French were lying,
the shore-line, after receding some distance from Aboukir
Point, turns to the south-east and continues in that direction
in a long narrow tongue of sand, behind which lies the
shallow Lake Madieh. North-east from the point is a line
of shoals and rocks, rising at two and a half miles' distance
into a small island, then bearing the same name, Aboukir,
but since known as Nelson's Island; beyond which the
same stretch of foul ground continues for another mile and
a quarter. Behind this four-mile barrier there is found fair
shelter from the prevailing north-west summer wind; but
as, for three miles from the beach, there were only four
fathoms of water, the order of battle had to be established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
somewhat beyond that distance. The north-western ship,
which with the prevailing wind would be to windward and
in the van, was moored a mile and a half south-east from
Aboukir Island, in five fathoms of water.
<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> This was scant
for a heavy vessel, but it does not seem that she was carried
as close to the shoal as she might have been. As the
van ship in the column, she was on one flank, and that the
most exposed, of the line-of-battle, whose broadsides were
turned to the sea. She should, therefore, have been brought
so near the shoal as not to leave room to swing, and there
been moored head and stern. So placed, the flank could
not have been turned, as it actually was. This was the
more necessary because the few guns established by Brueys
on the island were so light as to be entirely ineffective, in
range and weight, at the distance between them and the
flank they pretended to strengthen. They were a mere
toy defence, as futile as the other general dispositions
taken. This being so, it would seem that the frigates
might have been placed along the shoal ground ahead,
where the enemy's ships-of-the-line could not reach them,
and thence have supported the flank ship. From the latter,
the line extended south-east to, and including, the eighth in
the order, when it turned a little toward the beach; making
with its former direction a salient angle, but one very obtuse.
The distance from ship to ship was about one hundred and
sixty yards; from which, and from the average length of
the ships, it may be estimated that the whole line from van
to rear was nearly a mile and three quarters long. In case
of expecting attack, a cable was to be taken from ship to
ship to prevent the enemy passing through the intervals;
and springs also were then to be put upon the cable by
which each vessel was anchored.
<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be instructive to a professional reader to compare
the dispositions of Admiral Brueys, in Aboukir Bay, with
those adopted by Lord Hood in 1782, at St. Kitt's Island,
when expecting an attack at anchor from a very superior
force.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
The comparison is historically interesting as well
as instructive; for it has been said that Nelson framed his
own plan, in the cogitations of his long chase, upon Hood's
scheme for attacking the French fleet under Admiral
DeGrasse while lying at the anchorage from which he first
drove it, before occupying it himself. The parallel is quite
complete, for neither at St. Kitt's nor Aboukir was the
anchored fleet able to get substantial assistance from batteries.
The decisively important points in such a disposition,
as in any order of battle, land or sea, are—(1) that the line
cannot be pierced, and (2) that the flanks cannot be turned.
Hood thrust one flank ship so close to the shore that the
enemy could not pass round her, and closed up his intervals.
<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Brueys left the same flank—for in both cases it was
the van and weather ship—open to turning, with long spaces
between the vessels. In his arrangement for the other
flank, for the lee ships, Brueys was equally inferior. Hood
threw his eight lee ships at right angles to the rest of the
fleet, so that their broadsides completely protected the
latter from enfilading fire. Brueys simply bent his line a
little, with a view of approaching the rear to shoal water.
Failing thus to obtain a fire at right angles to the principal
line of battle, the rear did not contribute to strengthen
that; while, not actually reaching to shoal water, it remained
itself in the air, if attacked by the enemy in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
preference. This was the more singular, as Brueys had
expected the rear to be the object of the British efforts.
"I have asked," he wrote, "for two mortars to place upon
the shoal on which I have rested the head of my line; but
I have much less to fear for that part than for the rear,
upon which the enemy will probably bring to bear all their
effort."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
Nelson, however, whether illumined by Hood's
example, through that historical study of tactics for which
he was noted, or inspired only by his own genius, had well
understood beforehand that, if he found the French in
such order as they were, the van and centre were at his
mercy; and he had clearly imparted this view to his captains.
Hence, when the enemy were seen, he needed only
to signal "his intention was to attack the van and centre
as they lay at anchor, according to the plan before developed,"
<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
and could leave the details of execution to his
subordinates.</p>

<p>The evening before the eventful first of August, as the
British fleet expected to make Alexandria the next day, the
"Alexander" and "Swiftsure" were sent ahead to reconnoitre.
In consequence of this detachment, made necessary by
the want of frigates, these ships, when the main body at 1
<span class="sc">P.M.</span><a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
sighted the French fleet, were considerably to leeward, and
did not get into action until two hours after their consorts.
As soon as the enemy were seen, the British fleet hauled
sharp up on the wind, heading about north-east, to weather
Aboukir Island and shoal; the admiral at the same time
making signal to prepare for action, anchoring by the stern.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
As they drew by the shoal, being in eleven fathoms,
<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Nelson
hailed Captain Hood, of the "Zealous," and asked if he
thought they were far enough to the eastward to clear it;
for the only chart in the fleet was a rough sketch taken
from a captured merchant vessel, and no British officer
knew the ground. Hood replied that he would bear up,
sounding as he went, so that the other ships keeping outside
of him would be safe. Thus the fleet was piloted into
action; one ship, the "Goliath," being ahead of the "Zealous,"
but on her outer bow, and the admiral very properly allowing
others to pass him, until he was sixth in the order,
so as to be reasonably certain the flag-ship would not touch
the bottom. Captain Foley of the "Goliath," still keeping
the lead, crossed ahead of the French column, over the
ground left open by Brueys's oversight, intending to attack
the van ship, the "Guerrier;" but the anchor hung for a moment,
so that he brought up on the inner quarter of the second,
the "Conquérant," while Hood, following close after,
anchored on the bow of the "Guerrier." These two British
ships thus came into action shortly before sundown, the
French having opened fire ten minutes before. Five minutes
later, just as the sun was sinking below the horizon, the
foremast of the "Guerrier" went overboard. "So auspicious
a commencement of the attack was greeted with
three cheers by the whole British fleet."
<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The "Orion"
followed with a much wider sweep, passing round her
two leaders, between them and the shore, and anchored
on the inner side of the fifth French ship; while the
"Theseus," which came next, brought up abreast the third,
having gone between the "Goliath" and "Zealous" and
their antagonists. The "Audacious," the fifth of the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
to come up, chose a new course. Steering between the
"Guerrier " and the "Conquérant," she took her place on
the bow of the latter, already engaged on the quarter by
the "Goliath." These five all anchored on the inner (port)
side of the French. Nelson's ship, the "Vanguard," coming
next, anchored outside the third of the enemy's vessels, the
"Spartiate," thus placed between her and the "Theseus."
The "Minotaur," five minutes later, took the outer side of
the fourth, heretofore without an opponent; and the "Defence"
attacked, also on the outer side, the fifth ship,
already engaged on her inner side by the "Orion." Five
French seventy-fours were thus in hot action with eight
British of the same size, half an hour after the first British
gun was fired, and only five hours from the time Brueys
first knew that the enemy were near.</p>

<p>This most gallant, but most unfortunate, man had passed
suddenly from a condition of indolent security face to face
with an appalling emergency. When Nelson's fleet was
first reported, numbers of men were ashore, three miles or
more away, getting water for the ships. They were recalled,
but most of them did not return. Brueys still cherished
the belief, with which indeed he could not have parted
without despair, that the enemy would not brave the unknown
perils of the ground with night falling; nor could
he tell their purpose until they had passed Aboukir Island
and opened the bay. A hurried council of senior officers
renewed the decision previously reached, to fight, if fight
they must, at anchor; but Brueys betrayed the vacillations
of an unsteady purpose by crossing the light yards, a step
which could have no other significance than that of getting
under way. Still, he hoped for the respite of a night to
make the preparations so long neglected. Little did he
know the man whom England herself still hardly knew.
Without a moment's pause, without a tremor of uncertainty,
yet with all the precautions of a seaman, Nelson came
straight onward, facing with mind long prepared the difficulties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
of navigation, the doubts and obscurity of a night
action. Hurriedly the French prepare for battle; and,
secure that the enemy will not dare go within the line, the
batteries on that side are choked with the numerous encumbrances
of ship economy, the proper disposal of which is
termed "clearing for action."</p>

<p>For half an hour Brueys was a helpless and hopeless,
though undaunted, spectator of an overwhelming attack,
which he had never expected at all, delivered in a manner
he had deemed impossible upon the part of his order he
thought most secure. Soon he was freed from the agony
of mere passive waiting by the opportunity to act. The "Bellerophon"
and "Majestic," both seventy-fours, anchored
outside and abreast, respectively, of the flag-ship "Orient,"
of one hundred and twenty guns, and of the "Tonnant,"
eighty, next astern. Darkness had just settled down upon
the water as the arrival of these two ships completed the
first scene of the tragedy; and the British vessels, which
were fighting under their white ensign,
<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> as more easily seen
at night, now hoisted also four lanterns, horizontally arranged,
whereby to recognize each other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a woeful mishap had befallen Nelson's chosen
brother-in-arms, Troubridge. His ship, the "Culloden," had
been some distance from the main body of the fleet when
the latter rounded the shoal, and, doing her own piloting,
ran upon its outer extremity at a quarter before seven.
There she stuck, despite all the efforts of her most able
commander, until two o'clock the next morning, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
battle was over. There also, however, she served as a
beacon to the two remaining ships, "Alexander" and "Swiftsure,"
who had to make the perilous passage in the dark.
These vessels, with the "Leander," fifty, arriving after eight
o'clock, at a critical moment of the battle, played the part
of a reserve in a quarter where the British were meeting
with disaster.</p>

<p>Neither the "Bellerophon" nor the "Majestic" was equally
matched with the French ship opposed to it; but the "Bellerophon"
especially, having to do with a vessel double her
own force and having brought up fairly abreast, where she
got her full fire, was soon nearly a wreck. In three quarters
of an hour her main and mizzen masts were shot away,
and in thirty minutes more, unable longer to endure her
punishment, the cable was cut and she wore out of action.
As she did so, the foremast also fell, and, with forty-nine
killed and one hundred and forty-eight wounded, out of a
ship's company of six hundred and fifty men, the "Bellerophon"
drifted down the line, receiving the successive
broadsides of the French rear. As she thus passed, without
flag or light, the "Swiftsure" came up. Withholding
his fire, Captain Hallowell hailed, and finding her to be a
British ship, let go at once his anchor, bringing up on the
starboard bow of the "Orient." Immediately afterwards
the "Alexander" arrived and anchored on the port quarter
of the three-decker, while the "Leander," with the discretion
becoming her size, placed herself on the port bow of the
"Franklin," the next ahead to the "Orient," in a position of
comparative impunity, and thus raked both the French
ships. The French centre was thus in its turn the victim
of a concentration, similar to that with which the action
began in the van, and destined to result in a frightful
catastrophe.</p>

<p>At about nine in the evening the French flag-ship was
observed to be on fire, from what cause has never been certainly
known. The British guns, trained on the part in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
flames, helped to paralyze all efforts to extinguish them, and
they gained rapidly. The brave and unfortunate Brueys
was spared the sight of this last calamity. Already twice
wounded, at half-past eight a cannon-ball carried away his
left leg at the thigh. He refused to be taken below, and
passed away calmly and nobly a few moments before the
fire broke out. At ten the "Orient" blew up. Five ships
ahead of her had already surrendered, and the eighty-gun
ship "Franklin" also hauled down her flag before
midnight.</p>

<p>Six of the French still had their colors flying; but either
from their cables being cut by shot, or from the necessity
of slipping to avoid the explosion of the "Orient," they
had drifted far astern. The three in the extreme rear had
been but slightly engaged; of the others, the "Tonnant"
was totally dismasted, while the "Heureux" and "Mercure"
had received considerable injury.
<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The following morning
these vessels were attacked by some of the least injured
of the British, with the result that the "Tonnant," "Mercure,"
"Heureux" and "Timoléon," the last of which had
been the extreme rear, or flank, ship of the original order,
ran ashore. There the three first named afterwards hauled
down their flags, and the fourth was burned by her officers.
The two other French ships, "Guillaume Tell" and "Généreux,"
escaped. The former bore the flag of Rear-Admiral
Villeneuve, who had commanded the rear in this battle, and
was hereafter to be commander-in-chief of the allied fleet at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the memorable disaster of Trafalgar. His inaction on this
occasion has been sharply criticised, both in his own time
and since. Upon the whole, the feeling of later French professional
writers appears to be that his courage, though unquestionable,
was rather of the passive than the active type;
and that in Aboukir Bay there was afforded him a real opportunity
and sufficient time to bring the rear ships into
action, which he culpably failed to improve.
<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Bonaparte,
on the contrary, wrote to Villeneuve, soon after the battle,
that "if any error could be imputed to him, it was that he
had not got under way as soon as the 'Orient' blew up;
seeing that, three hours before, the position Brueys had
taken had been forced and surrounded."
<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Such was, in its main outlines, the celebrated Battle of
the Nile, the most complete of naval victories, and among
the most decisive, at least of the immediate course of
events. In it the French lost eleven out of thirteen ships-of-the-line
<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
and thirty-five hundred men, killed, wounded,
or drowned;<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
among them being the commander-in-chief
and three captains killed, a rear-admiral and six captains
wounded. The British loss was two hundred and eighteen
killed—-of which one captain—and six hundred and seventy-eight
wounded, among whom was the admiral himself,
struck in the head by a heavy splinter. The hurt,
which he at first thought fatal, disabled him for the moment
and seriously affected his efficiency for some days.
"I think," wrote he, four weeks later, "that if it had
pleased God I had not been wounded, not a boat would
have escaped."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>The particular circumstances under which the British
attack was undertaken, the admirable skill as well as
conduct shown by all the captains, and the thoroughly
scientific character of the tactical combination adopted,
as seen in its execution, unite with the decisiveness of the
issue to cast a peculiar lustre upon this victory of Nelson's.
Lord Howe, inferior to none as a judge of merit, said to
Captain Berry that the Battle of the Nile "stood unparalleled
and singular in this instance, that every captain distinguished
himself."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
It has been disputed how far belongs
to the admiral the credit of the bold manœuvre, whereby
the leading ship, passing ahead of the French line, showed
to her successors the open path through which the operation
of doubling on the enemy could be most effectually
carried out. Into this discussion the author has no intention
of entering, beyond noting an omission in the full
treatment of the question made by the careful and laborious
editor of Nelson's correspondence, Sir Harris Nicolas, who
was not able to reach a decision.
<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> In Ross's "Life of Admiral
Saumarez" it is stated that, while discussing the
various modes by which the enemy might be attacked,
Saumarez offended Nelson by saying that he "had seen the
evil consequences of doubling upon an enemy, especially
in a night action;" and had differed with the admiral in
the plan of attack, because "it never required two English
ships to capture one French, and that the damage which
they must necessarily do each other might render them
both unable to fight an enemy's ship which had not been engaged."
<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Saumarez's objection, though not without some
foundation, was justly over-ruled; but it could scarcely
have been raised had Nelson never contemplated the precise
method of doubling employed,—a British ship on each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
side of a single enemy,—for in no other position could the
risk of mutual injury have been serious.</p>

<p>It is in entire keeping with Nelson's well-known character,
that, after discussing all likely positions and ascertaining
that his captains understood his views, he should with
perfect and generous confidence have left all the details of
immediate action with them. In the actual case he could
not, without folly, have rigorously prescribed to Captain
Foley what path to follow. Only the man on the "Goliath's"
deck, watching the soundings, could rightly judge what
must each instant be done; and it was no less a transcendent
merit in Nelson that he could thus trust another, than
that, with falling night and unknown waters, he could reach
the instant decision to attack an enemy of superior force,
in an order which he must have supposed to be carefully
and rationally assumed. In fact, however, the operation of
doubling on the enemy,—in contradistinction to doubling
the head of the line,—was really begun by Nelson himself;
for his ship was the first to anchor on the side opposite to
that taken by her five predecessors. It was open to him to
have followed them, for the same reasons that prompted
Foley's action.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
Instead of that, he deliberately anchored
outside the third French ship, already engaged on the inside
by the "Theseus;" thus indicating, as clearly as
example can, what he would have those succeeding him to
do. The first two French ships were already so engaged or
crippled as to be properly passed. The fullest credit therefore
can be allowed to Captain Foley for a military decision
of a very high order, without stripping a leaf from Nelson's
laurels.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"The boldness and skill of Admiral Nelson," says Captain
Chevalier, "rose to a height which it would have been
difficult to surpass."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
"The action of Nelson," said Napoleon,
"was a desperate action which cannot be proposed as
a model, but in which he displayed, as well as the English
crews, all the skill and vigor possible."
<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> This sentence is
susceptible of a double construction. The condemnation,
if the words be meant as such, comes ill from the man who
pushed on his desperate advance to Leoben in 1797, who at
Marengo stretched his line till it broke, and who in 1798
ventured the Mediterranean fleet and the Army of Italy on
the Egyptian expedition, with scarce a chance in his favor,
except a superstitious reliance upon a fortune which did not
betray him. The arrangements of Brueys being what they
were, the odds were with the British admiral.</p>

<p>It has been said that, with better gunnery on the part of
the French, disaster must have resulted to the attacking
force; and precisely the same criticism has been applied
to Trafalgar.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
Now, putting out of consideration that
Great Britain had at this date been for five years at war
with France, and that British seamen had thus gained an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
experience of French gunnery upon which Nelson could
reckon, the justice of this criticism further depends upon
the circumstances of the wind and the character of the approach.
An attack made with a very light wind, leaving
the assailant long under the enemy's fire, or with a fresh
breeze on a course that lies close to the wind, thereby
bringing the greatest strain upon the spars, is a very different
thing from one made with a good working breeze
well abaft the beam, which was the case at the Nile. One
cannot dogmatize on probabilities when, from the nature
of the case, there are few precedents on which to rest an
opinion. In bearing down against a fleet under way, of
which there are many instances, the experience in scarcely
any case was that so many spars were lost as to prevent
the assailant reaching the hostile line; and at the Nile,
once the anchor was down, the loss of a spar or two was
of little consequence. It seems altogether probable that,
had the French gunnery been much better than it was, the
British ships would yet have reached their station; and
once there, the tactical combination adopted would still
have given them the victory, though more dearly bought.
If, however, Brueys's arrangements had been more skilfully
made, resembling those of Hood at St. Kitt's, and if
the French gunnery had been very good, it may safely be
conceded that the British admiral would have needed more
circumspection in making his attack. To say that under
totally different circumstances different results will obtain,
is a species of prophecy with which no one need quarrel.
If, in the shock of war, all things on both sides are exactly
equal,—if the two admirals, their captains and crews, the
ships of the fleets, the tactical arrangements, are equal,
each to each,—there can be no result. When inequality,
whether original or induced by circumstance, enters in any
one of these factors, a result will follow proportional to
the disparity. When this is great, the result will be great;
when small, small. At the Battle of the Nile, the difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
in admirals, in captains, in crews, in gunnery, and in
tactical combination, were all greatly against the French,
and the result was a disaster more than usually complete.</p>

<p>During the month passed by Brueys in indolent security,
Bonaparte had advanced steadily in his projected conquest
of Egypt. On the 21st of July the battle of the Pyramids
was fought, the next day Cairo submitted, and on the 25th
the general-in-chief entered the city. Remaining there a
few days to repose his troops and secure his position, he
departed again on the 7th of August to complete the conquest
of lower Egypt; leaving Desaix to take care of Cairo
and prepare the corps destined for the subjugation of the
upper Nile. By the 12th of August the Mamelukes, still
under arms in the Delta, had been driven into the Isthmus
of Suez, whence they retired to Syria; and there, on the
borders of the desert, Bonaparte received from Kleber the
news of the disaster in Aboukir Bay. Under this tremendous
reverse he showed the self-control of which he was
always capable at need. The troops gave way to despair.
"Here we are," said they, "abandoned in this barbarous
country, without communication with home, without hope
of return." "Well," replied their general, "we have then
laid on us the obligation to do great things. Seas which
we do not command separate us from home; but no seas
divide us from Africa and Asia. We will found here an
empire."</p>

<p>The magical influence he exerted over the soldiers, most
of whom had followed him to victory in Italy, restored
their courage, and French lightheartedness again prevailed
over despondency. The blow, nevertheless, had struck
home, and resounded through the four quarters of the
world. The Mamelukes, Ibrahim Bey in Syria, and Mourad
Bey in upper Egypt, cast down by their reverses, were
preparing to treat; upon the news of Nelson's victory they
resumed their arms. The Porte, incensed by the invasion
of Egypt, but still hesitating, notwithstanding the pressure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
exerted by the ministers of Great Britain and Russia, took
heart as soon as it knew that the French fleet was no more.
Bonaparte had rightly warned Brueys that the preservation
of his ships was necessary to hold Turkey in check.
The Sultan and his Pashas of Egypt and Syria rejected the
French advances. On the 2d of September a memorial
was sent to all the foreign ministers in Constantinople, expressing
the surprise of the Porte at Bonaparte's landing,
and stating that a considerable force had been despatched
for Egypt to stop his progress. On the 11th of the month
war was formally declared against the French Republic.
<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the year 1798 the state of affairs on the
continent of Europe had grown continually more threatening.
The politico-military propagandism of the Revolution
had given birth to, and was now being replaced by, an aggressive
external policy, to which the victories of Bonaparte
gave increased vigor and extension. It became the
recognized, if not the avowed, aim of French diplomacy to
surround France with small dependent republics, having institutions
modelled upon the same type as her own, with
all local powers merged in those of a central government.
<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
The United Provinces, in becoming a republic, had retained
their federal constitution; but in January, 1798, they underwent
a revolution, promoted by the French Directory,
which did away with the provincial independence inherited from
past ages. The Cisalpine Republic and Genoa had received
a similar organization at the hands of Bonaparte.
In many of the cantons of Switzerland there were discontent
and disturbance, due to the unequal political conditions
of the inhabitants. The Directory made of this a
pretext for interference, on the plea of France being interested
both in the internal quiet of a neighboring country
and also in the particular persons whose discontent was
construed as evidence of oppression. French troops entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Switzerland in January, 1798. The canton of Berne
fought for its privileges, but was easily subdued; and a
packed convention, assembled at Aarau, adopted for Switzerland
a centralized constitution in place of the old cantonal
independence. This was followed some months later,
in August, 1798, by an offensive and defensive alliance
between the Helvetian and French republics.</p>

<p>The invasion of Berne had had another motive than the
political preponderance of France in the councils of her
neighbors. The revenue of the Directory still fell far short
of the expenditure, and money was particularly wanted for
Bonaparte's approaching expedition. Seventeen million
francs were found in the Bernese treasury and appropriated.
Eighteen million more were raised by requisitions,
and other cantons were drained in proportion.
<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The same
motive contributed,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
at the same instant, to the occupation
of Rome, for which a more plausible pretext was found.
In the papal states, as elsewhere throughout Europe, French
agents had secretly stirred up a revolutionary movement.
On the 28th of December, 1797, this party had risen in
Rome, and a collision between it and the papal troops had
occurred in the neighborhood of the French embassy.
General Duphot, who was then residing there, was killed
while attempting to interpose between the combatants.
The French ambassador at once left the city; and the
Directory, refusing all explanations, ordered Berthier,
Bonaparte's successor in Italy, to advance. On the 10th
of February he entered Rome, recognized the Roman Republic,
which was proclaimed under his auspices, and
forced the Pope to retire to Tuscany. It was owing to this
occupation that a contingent of the Egyptian expedition
embarked at Civita Vecchia, as the most convenient point.</p>

<p>Neither Naples nor Austria ventured on overt action in
behalf of the Pope; but the dissatisfaction of both was
extreme. Never under Bonaparte himself had French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
troops come so near to the kingdom of the Two Sicilies,
whose importance to the common cause of the Continent,
from its geographical position, was perfectly understood.
But while the situation of Naples at the far end of the
peninsula made it a serious danger to the flank and rear
of the French, when engaged with an enemy in upper Italy,
its remoteness from support, except by way of the sea, was
a source of weakness to a state necessarily dependent upon
allies. This was especially felt in February, 1798, when
the British fleet, after a year's absence, had as yet given no
sign of returning to the Mediterranean, and the ships which
accompanied Bonaparte to Egypt were still in Toulon. The
latter would doubtless have been directed upon Naples, had
Naples moved against Rome. The Bourbon kingdom therefore
swallowed its vexation, but drew closer to Austria;
which, in addition to the affront offered to the Pope, had
its own motives for discontent in the occupation of Switzerland
by the French, and in the changes introduced into the
political complexion of the Continent by these aggressive
actions of the republican government. The course of the
Directory during the continental peace of 1797 and 1798
was closely parallel to that of Bonaparte four years later,
which made impossible the continuance of the Peace of
Amiens. With less ability and less vigor, there was the
same plausible, insidious, steady aggression, under color
of self-protection or of yielding to popular demand, which
forced on the power of France at the expense of other
states. An occurrence in Vienna at this moment came
near to produce war and stop the Egyptian expedition.
When Bonaparte entered Germany in April, 1797, the
youth of Vienna had offered themselves in mass to defend
the country. In April, 1798, the anniversary of the day
was celebrated with a popular demonstration, which the
French ambassador resented by hoisting the tricolor. The
crowds in a rage broke into and sacked the embassy.
<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
great was the excitement over this affair that the troops in
Toulon and other ports were ordered not to embark, and
Bonaparte himself was directed to go as plenipotentiary to
Rastadt; but the emperor made explanations, and the incident
passed. Still, as a French historian says, "things
were getting spoiled between Austria and France."
<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Russia at the same time was fairly forced from her attitude
of reserve, maintained since the death of Catherine II.,
by the same policy which drove the United States into the
<i>quasi</i> war of 1798 with France.
<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> A decree of the French
legislature had made lawful prize any neutral ship which
had on board, not merely British property, but any goods
of British origin, even though the property of a neutral.
This was given a special application to the Baltic by a
notification, issued January 12, 1798, that "if any ship be
suffered to pass through the Sound with English commodities,
of whatever nation it may be, it shall be considered as
a formal declaration of war against the French nation."
<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
Although immediately directed against Sweden and Denmark,
as the two countries bordering the Sound, this was
resented by the Czar, in common with all neutral governments;
and on the 15th of May, he "ordered twenty-two
ships-of-the-line and two hundred and fifty galleys to proceed
to the Sound, to protect trade in general against the
oppression of the Directory."

<a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Once enkindled, the violent and erratic temper of
Paul I. soon rushed into extremes; and he received
further provocation from the capture of Malta. When
Bonaparte took possession of that island, he found there
a treaty, just signed, by which the Czar stipulated a
payment of four hundred thousand rubles to the Order,
in which to the end of his days he preserved a fantastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
interest. As a measure of precaution, the French
general decreed that any Greeks in Malta or the Ionian Islands
maintaining relations with Russia should be shot, and
Greek vessels under Russian colors sunk.
<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Hence the
members of the Order in Russia made, in August, a violent
protest against the seizure, throwing themselves upon the
Czar for a support which he eagerly promised.
<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> He then
drew near to Great Britain, and offered to aid Austria with
troops. The emperor at first answered that nothing could
be done without Prussia; and the three governments then
applied themselves to obtain the accession of this kingdom
to a new coalition. On the 19th of May—the very day,
it may be observed, that Bonaparte sailed from Toulon—Austria
and Naples signed a defensive alliance.
<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The conferences
at Rastadt, so far as the emperor was concerned,
were broken off on the 6th of July, although those with the
empire dragged on longer. The imperial envoy, Cobentzel,
at once went to Berlin, where he entered into cordial relations
with the British and Russian plenipotentiaries. On
the 10th of August a convention was signed between the
two emperors, by which the Czar undertook to send thirty
thousand troops into Galicia to support the Austrian army.
Great Britain, as ever, was ready to help the cause with
ships and money. Prussia refusing to join, the Russian envoy
took his leave, saying: "We will make war on France
with you, without you, or against you."
<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>On governments so prepared to be enkindled, yet hesitating
before the prestige of French success and feeling the
mutual distrust inseparable from coalitions, the news of the
battle of the Nile fell like a brand among tinder. The
French fleet was not only defeated, but annihilated. The
Mediterranean from the Straits to the Levant was in the
power of the British navy, which the total destruction of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
enemy relieved from the necessity of concentration and allowed
to disperse to every quarter where its efforts were
needed. The greatest general and thirty thousand of the
best troops France possessed, with numbers of her most
brilliant officers, were thus hopelessly shut off from
their country.</p>

<p>After the victory, conscious of its far-reaching importance,
Nelson took measures to disperse the news as rapidly
as his want of small vessels would permit. The "Leander"
sailed on the 5th of August with the first despatches for
Lord St. Vincent off Cadiz, but was on the 18th captured by
the "Généreux," seventy-four, one of the two ships which
had escaped from Aboukir Bay. To provide against such an
accident, however, the brig "Mutine" had also been sent
on the 13th to Naples, where she arrived on the 4th of
September, bringing the first news that reached Europe, and
which Nelson asked the British minister to see forwarded to
all the other courts. The captain of the "Mutine" started
the next day for England, by way of Vienna, and on the 2d
of October, 1798, two full months after the battle, reached
London with the first accounts.</p>

<p>Conscious of the effect which events in Egypt might have
upon British influence in India, Nelson also sent a lieutenant,
on the 10th of August, to make his way overland
through Alexandretta and Aleppo to Bombay. This officer
bore dispatches to the governor, informing him both of the
landing and numbers of Bonaparte's expedition, and also
of the fatal blow which had just befallen it. The news was
most timely. The French had been actively intriguing in
the native courts, and Tippoo Saib, the son and successor
of Hyder Ali, Sultan of Mysore, their former ally in the
days of Suffren, had openly committed himself to his
father's policy. It was too late for Tippoo to recede, and
he was erelong embarked in a war, which ended in April,
1799, in his death at the assault of Seringapatam and the
overthrow of his kingdom; but on the other native states
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the striking catastrophe produced its due impression. In
their operations against Tippoo the British were not embarrassed
by troubles in other quarters.</p>

<p>"The consequences of this battle," sums up a brilliant
French naval writer, "were incalculable. Our navy never
recovered from this terrible blow to its consideration and
its power. This was the combat which for two years delivered
the Mediterranean to the English, and called thither
the squadrons of Russia; which shut up our army in the
midst of a rebellious population, and decided the Porte to
declare against us; which put India out of the reach of our
enterprise, and brought France within a hair's-breadth of
her ruin; for it rekindled the scarcely extinct war with
Austria, and brought Suwarrow and the Austro-Russians to
our very frontiers."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
Great Britain, the Sea Power so
often and so idly accused of backwardness in confronting
France, of requiring continental support before daring to
move, was first to act. Long before news of the battle, before
even the battle was fought, or the alliance of Austria
and Russia contracted, orders had been sent to St. Vincent
to detach from Nelson's force to the support of Naples,
hoping there to start the little fire from which a great matter
should be kindled. These "most secret orders"
reached Nelson on the 15th of August.
<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> He had just
dispatched to Gibraltar seven of the British fleet with six
of the captured French vessels, the whole under charge of
Sir James Saumarez. Setting fire to the three other prizes,
he intrusted the blockade of Alexandria to Captain Hood,
with three ships-of-the-line, and with the three then remaining
to him sailed for Naples on the 19th. From the
wretched condition of his division
<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> the passage took over a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
month; but on the 22d of September he anchored in the
bay, where the renown of his achievement had preceded him.</p>

<p>On his way, Nelson had been informed that a Portuguese
squadron, commanded by the Marquis de Niza, had entered
the Mediterranean to support his operations. At his request
this division, which had appeared off Alexandria on
the 29th of August,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
but refused to remain there, undertook
the blockade of Malta, until such time as the repairs
of the British ships should allow them to do so. The natives
of the island had risen against the French on the 26th
of August, and driven them from the open country into the
forts of La Valetta. Niza took his station off the port,
about the 20th of September, and on the 24th Sir James
Saumarez appeared with his division and the prizes. The
following day the two officers sent General Vaubois a summons
to surrender, which was as a matter of course refused.
Saumarez went on to Gibraltar; but before doing
so gave the inhabitants twelve hundred muskets with ammunition,
which materially assisted them in their efforts,
finally successful, to deprive the enemy of the resources of
the island. Nelson sent off British ships as they were ready,
and himself joined the blockading force on the 24th of October,
though only for a few days, his presence being necessary
in Naples. The garrison was again by him formally
summoned, and as formally rejected his offers. From that
time until their surrender in September, 1800, the French
were in strict blockade, both by land and water.</p>

<p>In October of this year Lord St. Vincent went to live
ashore at Gibraltar, both on account of his health, and because
there, being the great British naval station of the Mediterranean,
he was centrally placed to receive information, to
give orders, and especially to hasten, by his unflagging personal
supervision, the work of supply and repair upon which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
the efficiency of a fleet primarily depends. The division
off Cadiz, numbering generally some fifteen of the line,
kept its old station watching the Spaniards, under the command
of Lord Keith,—one of the most efficient and active
of the generation of naval officers between St. Vincent and
Nelson, to the latter of whom he was senior. Within the
Mediterranean Nelson commanded, under St. Vincent.
The blockade of Egypt and Malta, and co-operation with
the Austrian and Neapolitan armies in the expected war,
were his especial charge. He was also to further, as far
as in him lay, the operations of a combined Russian and
Turkish fleet, which had assembled in the Dardanelles in
September, 1798, to maintain the cause of the coalition in
the Levant. This fleet entered the Mediterranean in October;
but instead of assuming the blockade of Alexandria
and the protection of the Syrian coast, it undertook the
capture of the Ionian Islands. All of these, except Corfu,
fell into its power by October 10; and on the 20th Corfu,
the citadel of the group, was attacked. Nelson saw this
direction of the Russo-Turkish operations with disgust and
suspicion. "The Porte ought to be aware," he wrote, "of
the great danger at a future day of allowing the Russians
to get a footing at Corfu."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> "I was in hopes that a part
of the united Turkish and Russian squadron would have
gone to Egypt,—Corfu is a secondary consideration....
I have had a long conference with Kelim Effendi on the
conduct likely to be pursued by the Russian Court towards
the unsuspicious (I fear) and upright Turk.... A strong
squadron should have been sent to Egypt to have relieved
my dear friend Captain Hood; but Corfu suited Russia
better."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
At the same time Turkish troops, under the
pashas whose good dispositions Bonaparte had boasted,
swept away from France the former Venetian territory on
the mainland, acquired by the treaty of Campo Formio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>While Bonaparte's Oriental castles were thus crumbling,
through the destruction in Aboukir Bay of the foundation
upon which they rested,—while Ionia was falling, Malta
starving, and Egypt isolated, through the loss of the sea—the
Franco-Spanish allies were deprived of another important
foothold for maritime power. On the 15th of November
Minorca with its valuable harbor, Port Mahon, was surrendered
to a combined British military and naval expedition,
quietly fitted out by St. Vincent from Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The year 1798 in the Mediterranean closed with these
operations in progress. At its beginning France was in
entire control of the land-locked sea, and scarcely a sail
hostile to her, except furtive privateers, traversed its surface.
When it closed, only two French ships-of-the-line fit
for battle remained upon the waters, which swarmed with
enemy's squadrons. Of these two, refugees from the fatal
bay of Aboukir, one was securely locked in Malta, whence
she never escaped; the other made its way to Toulon, and
met its doom in a vain effort to carry relief to the beleaguered
island.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AFTER the destruction of his fleet, Bonaparte resumed
the task of subduing and organizing Egypt, which
had by that misfortune become more than ever essential to
his projects. In the original conception of his eastern adventure
the valley of the Nile had borne a twofold part.
It was, in the first place, to become a permanent acquisition
of France, the greatest of her colonies,—great not only
by its own natural resources, susceptible as was believed of
immense development, but also by its singular position,
which, to a power controlling the Mediterranean waters,
gave the military and commercial link between the eastern
and western worlds. To France, bereft of the East and
the West Indies, childless now of her richest colonies, Egypt
was to be the great and more than equal compensation.
But this first object obtained, though in itself a
justification, was but the necessary step to the more dazzling,
if not more useful, achievement of the destruction of
the British power in India, and the creation there of an empire
tributary to France. "Thus, on the one side Egypt
would replace San Domingo and the Antilles; on the other,
she would be a step towards the conquest of India."
<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Measured by the successes of a few handfuls of British
in the empire of the Moguls, the army brought by Bonaparte
into Egypt was more than able to subdue that country,
and to spread far and wide the obedience to the French
arms. Like the founders of the British Indian Empire,
the French general found himself face to face, not only with
military institutions incomparably weaker and less cohesive
than those of Europe, but with a civil society—if such it
can be called—from which the element of mutual confidence,
and with it the power of combined resistance, had
disappeared. The prestige of success, the knowledge that
he could command the services of a body of men superior
in numbers as in disciplined action to any aggregation of
units that could be kept steadily together to oppose him,
was sufficient to insure for him the supremacy that concentrated
force will always have over diffused force, organized
power over unorganized. In military matters two and
two do not make four, unless they are brought together in
concerted action. Unfortunately, at the very moment of
the most brilliant demonstration of his genius and of the
valor of his troops, there had fallen upon one part of his
command a reverse more startling, more absolute, than his
own victories, and inflicted by a force certainly not superior
to the one defeated. The Orientals, who could count
upon no sufficient stay in men of their own race, now saw
hopes of succor from without. They were not disappointed.
Again a British naval captain, in the moment of triumphant
progress, stopped the advance of Bonaparte.</p>

<p>The autumn and early winter of 1798 were passed in the
conquest and overrunning of upper Egypt by Desaix, who
left Cairo for this purpose on the 25th of August, and
in the settlement of the affairs of the lower Nile upon such
a basis as would secure quiet and revenue during the absence
of the commander-in-chief. An insurrection in Cairo
in October, provoked partly by dissatisfaction with intended
changes, partly by the rumor of the Porte having declared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
war upon France, gave Bonaparte in quelling it an opportunity
to show the iron firmness of his grip, and afterwards
to manifest that mixture of unrelenting severity towards
the few with politic lenity towards the many, which is so
well calculated to check the renewal of commotion.</p>

<p>In November, when the weather became cooler, a detachment
of fifteen hundred men was sent to occupy Suez, and
toward the end of December Bonaparte himself made a visit
of inspection to the isthmus, by which he must advance to
the prosecution of his larger schemes. While thus absent
he learned, through an intercepted courier, that Djezzar, the
Pasha of Syria, had on the 2d of January, 1799, occupied
the important oasis of El Arish in the desert of Suez, and
was putting its fort in a state of defence.
<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> He at once realized
that the time had come when he must carry out his
project of advance into Syria, and accept the hostility of
Turkey, which he had wished to avoid.</p>

<p>The singular position of isolation in which the French in
Egypt were placed, by the loss of the control of the sea,
must be realized, in order to understand the difficulties
under which Bonaparte labored in shaping his course of
action, from time to time, with reference to the general current
of events. Separated from Palestine by two hundred
miles of desert, and by a yet wider stretch of barren sand
from any habitable land to the west, Egypt is aptly described
by Napoleon himself as a great oasis, surrounded
on all sides by the desert and the sea. The intrinsic weakness
of the French navy, its powerlessness to command
security for its unarmed vessels in the Mediterranean, had
been manifested by the tremor of apprehension and uncertainty
which ran through the officials at Toulon and in
Paris, when, after the sailing of Bonaparte, they learned of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Nelson's appearance. The restless activity of the British
admiral, and the frequent sight of his ships in different
places, multiplied, in the imagination of the French authorities,
the numbers of hostile cruisers actually on the sea.
<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
A convoy of twenty-six large ships, for the completion of
whose lading the expedition could not wait, lay in Toulon
during the summer months, ready to sail; but no one dared
to despatch them. From time to time during the outward
voyage Bonaparte sent urgent messages for their speedy departure;
but they never came.</p>

<p>If this fear existed and exercised such sway before the
day of the Nile, it may be imagined how great was the influence
of that disastrous tidings. Not only, however, did
a moral effect follow, but the annihilation of the French
fleet permitted the British cruisers to scatter, and so indefinitely
increased the real danger of capture to French
ships. Surrounded by deserts and the sea, the commander-in-chief
in Egypt saw, on and beyond both, nothing but
actual or possible enemies. Not only so, but being in utter
ignorance of the attitude of most of the powers as well as
of European events, he could not know what bad effect
might result from action taken by him upon imperfect information.
His embarrassment is vividly depicted in a
letter dated December 17, 1798: "We are still without
news from France, not a courier has arrived since July 6;
this is unexampled even in the colonies."
<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The courier mentioned,
leaving France in July, had reached Bonaparte on
the 9th of September; but the vessel which brought him had
been obliged to run ashore to escape the British cruisers,
and only one letter from the Directory was saved.
<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The
next tidings came on the 5th of February, when a Ragusan
ship, chartered by two French citizens, succeeded in entering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Alexandria. "The news," he said, "is sufficiently
contradictory; but it is the first I have had since July 6."
He then first learned definitely that Turkey had declared
war against France.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
His troops were at that moment in
the desert, marching upon Syria, and he himself on the
point of following them.</p>

<p>Up to that time Bonaparte had hoped to cajole the Porte
into an attitude of neutrality, upon the plea that his quarrel
was solely with the Mamelukes on account of injury done
by them to French commerce. On the 11th of December
he had sent to Constantinople a M. Beauchamp, recently
consul at Muscat, with instructions how to act in the twofold
contingency of war having been declared or not. At
that time he expected that Talleyrand would be found in
Constantinople as Ambassador of France.
<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The news by
the Ragusan enlightened him as to the actual relations with
Turkey; but the disquieting rumors before received, coinciding
with his ultimate purpose to advance upon India
through Syria, had already determined him to act as the
military situation demanded.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> He had learned that troops
were assembling in Syria and in the island of Rhodes, and
divined that he was threatened with a double invasion,—by
the desert of Suez and by the Mediterranean Sea.
True to his sound and invariable policy, he determined to
use his central position to strike first one and then the
other, and not passively to wait on the defensive until a
simultaneous attack might compel him to divide his force.
During the violent winter weather, which would last yet for
six weeks or two months, landing on the Egyptian coast was
thought impracticable.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> For that period, probably for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
longer, he could count upon security on the side of the sea.
He would improve the interval by invading Syria, driving
back the enemy there, breaking up his army, and seizing
his ports. Thus he would both shut the coast to the
British cruisers off Alexandria, which drew supplies from
thence, and make impossible any future invasion from the
side of the desert. He counted also upon the moral effect
which success in Syria would have upon the negotiations
with the Porte, which he conceived to be in progress.
<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>The first essential point in the campaign was to possess
El Arish, just occupied by the troops of Djezzar. General
Reynier advanced against it with his division on the 5th of
February, 1799. The Turks were by him routed and driven
from the oasis, and the fort besieged. Bonaparte himself
arrived on the 15th, and on the 20th the garrison capitulated.
The corps destined for the expedition, numbering
in all thirteen thousand men, having now assembled, the
advance from El Arish began on the 22d. On the 25th
Gaza was taken. On the 3d of March the army encamped
before Jaffa, and on the 7th the place was carried by storm.
A port, though a very poor one, was thus secured. The
next day there entered, from Acre, a convoy of Turkish
coasters laden with provisions and ammunition, which fell a
welcome prize to the French, and was sent back to Hayfa, a
small port seven miles south of Acre, for the use of the
troops upon arrival. On the 12th of March the army resumed
its march upon Acre, distant about sixty miles. On
the 17th, at five in the afternoon, a detachment entered
and held Hayfa, to provide a place of safety for the flotilla,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
which, coasting the beach, slowly followed the advance of
the troops. From Hayfa Bonaparte could see the roadstead
of Acre, and lying there two British ships-of-the-line, the
"Tigre" and the "Theseus," both under the command of Sir
Sidney Smith, the captain of the former; who, as ranking
officer on the spot, represented the naval power of Great
Britain, about again to foil the plans of the great French
leader.</p>

<p>Sir Sidney Smith, to whom now fell the distinguished
duty of meeting and stopping the greatest general of modern
times, was a man who has left behind him a somewhat
singular reputation, in which, and in the records commonly
accessible, it is not always easy to read his real character.
He was not liked by St. Vincent nor by Nelson, and their
feeling towards him, though much intensified by the circumstances
under which he now came to the Mediterranean,
seems to have depended upon their previous
knowledge of his history. The First Lord, in assigning
him to this duty, felt obliged to take an almost apologetic
tone to Earl St. Vincent. "I am well aware," he wrote,
"that there may perhaps be some prejudices, derived from
certain circumstances which have attended this officer's
career through life; but, from a long acquaintance with
him personally, I think I can venture to assure your lordship
that, added to his unquestioned character for courage
and enterprise, he has a great many good points about him,
which those who are less acquainted with him may not be
sufficiently apprised of. I have no doubt you will find him
a very useful instrument to be employed on any hazardous
or difficult service, and that he will be perfectly under
your guidance, as he ought to be."

<a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> In the concluding
sentence Earl Spencer sums up Sir Sidney's real character,
as far as it can be discerned in the dim light of the recorded
facts—or rather in the false lights which have exaggerated
some circumstances and distorted others. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
was bold and enterprising to Quixotism; he was a most
useful instrument; but so far from having no doubt, the
First Lord must have had very serious, if unacknowledged,
doubts as to how far he would be under the guidance of
St. Vincent, or any one else, out of signal distance. A
self-esteem far beyond what the facts warranted, a self-confidence
of the kind which does not inspire confidence in
others, an exaggerated view of his own importance and of
his own services, which was apt to show itself in his bearing
and words,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>—such seem to
have been the traits that
alienated from Sir Sidney Smith the esteem of his contemporaries,
until his really able, as well as most gallant, conduct
at Acre showed that there was more in him than the
mere vainglorious knight-errant. His behavior even there
has been distorted, alike by the malevolence of Napoleon
and by the popular adulation in Great Britain, which, seizing
upon the brilliant traits of energy and valor he exhibited,
attributed to him the whole conduct of the siege;
<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
whereas, by entrusting the technical direction of the defence
to an experienced engineer, he made proof of a wisdom
and modesty for which few of his contemporaries
would have given him credit. At this time Smith had received
some severe snubbings, which, administered by men
of the standing of St. Vincent and Nelson, could not be
disregarded, and may have had a wholesomely sobering
effect.</p>

<p>The circumstances of his coming to the Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
were as follows. Having been a prisoner of war in Paris
for nearly two years, he escaped through the stratagem of
a French royalist, Phélippeaux, about a week before Bonaparte
left the city for Toulon.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The incidents of his release
were dramatic enough in themselves, and, in common
with all his adventures, were well noised abroad. He became
a very conspicuous figure in the eyes of the government,
and of the public outside the navy. In October,
1798, he was given command of the "Tigre," with directions
to proceed to Gibraltar and put himself under St.
Vincent's orders. At the same time he was appointed
minister plenipotentiary to the Porte, being associated in
that capacity with his younger brother, Spencer Smith,
who was already ambassador at Constantinople; the object
being that, with the diplomatic rank thus conferred,
he should be able to direct the efforts of the Turkish and
Russian forces in the Levant, in case the military officers
of those nations were of grade superior to his. This somewhat
complicated arrangement, which presupposed in the
Turks and Russians a compliance which no British naval
officer would have yielded, was further confused by the instructions
issued, apparently without concert, by the Foreign
Office to Smith himself, and by the Admiralty to St.
Vincent. The latter clearly understood that Smith was
intended to be under his command only, and that merely
<i>pro formâ</i>;<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
but under no obedience to Nelson, although
his intended scene of operations, the Levant, was part of
Nelson's district. This view, derived from the Admiralty's
letter, was confirmed by an extract from the Foreign Office
instructions, communicated by Smith to Nelson, that "his
(Smith's) instructions will enable him to take the command
of such of his Majesty's ships as he may find in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
those seas (the Levant) unless, <i>by some unforeseen accident</i>,
it should happen that there should be among them
any of his Majesty's officers of superior rank."
<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Nelson, of course, was outraged. Here was intruded into
his command, where he had achieved such brilliant success,
and to the administration of which he felt fully equal, a
man of indifferent reputation as an officer, though of unquestioned
courage, authorized to act independently of his
control, and, as it seemed, even to take his ships. He was
hurt not only for himself, but for Troubridge, who was
senior to Smith, and would, so Nelson thought, have done
the duty better than this choice of the Government. The
situation when understood in England was rectified. It
was explained that diplomatic rank was considered necessary
for the senior naval officer, in order to keep in the
hands of Great Britain the direction of combined operations,
essentially naval in character; and that Smith had
been chosen to the exclusion of seniors because of his relationship
to the minister at Constantinople, who might have
felt the association with him of a stranger to be an imputation
upon his past conduct. Meanwhile St. Vincent,
indignant at what seemed to him Smith's airs, had sent
him peremptory instructions to put himself under Nelson's
orders. Thus, in the double character of naval captain and
minister plenipotentiary to Turkey, Smith went up the
Mediterranean; where he did first-rate service in the
former capacity, and in the latter took some action of
very doubtful discretion, in which he certainly did not
trouble himself about the guidance or views of his naval
superiors.</p>

<p>In compliance with orders from Lord St. Vincent, Nelson
in January sent Troubridge with some bomb-vessels to
Alexandria, to bombard the shipping in the port; after performing
which service he was to turn over to Sir Sidney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Smith the blockade of Alexandria and the defence of the
Ottoman Empire by sea, of which Nelson thenceforth
washed his hands.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The bombardment was maintained
during several days in February, doing but little harm;
and on the 3d of March Sir Sidney, having made his round
to Constantinople, arrived and took over the command.
Troubridge left with him the "Theseus," seventy-four,
whose captain was junior to Smith, with three smaller
vessels; and on the 7th sailed to rejoin Nelson. This was
the day that the French stormed Jaffa, and the same evening
an express with the news reached the "Tigre." Smith
at once sent the "Theseus" to Acre, with Phélippeaux, the
French officer who had aided him to escape from Paris and
had accompanied him to the East.</p>

<p>Of the same age as Bonaparte, Phélippeaux had been his
fellow-pupil at the military school of Brienne, had left
France with the royalists in 1792, and returned to it after
the fall of Robespierre. He had naturally, from his antecedents,
joined the party of reaction; and, after its overthrow
in September, 1797, was easily moved to aid in Sir
Sidney's escape from Paris. Accompanying him to England,
he received from the Crown a colonel's commission.
To the guidance of this able engineer the wisdom and skill
of the defence was mainly due. Never did great issues
turn on a nicer balance than at Acre. The technical skill
of Phélippeaux, the hearty support he received from Smith,
his officers and crews, the untiring activity and brilliant
courage of the latter, the British command of the sea, all
contributed; and so narrow was the margin of success,
that it may safely be said the failure of one factor would
have caused total failure and the loss of the place. Its
fall was essential to Bonaparte, and his active, far-seeing
mind had long before determined its seizure by his squadron,
if the British left the Levant. "If any event drives us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
from the coast of Egypt," wrote Nelson on the 17th of
December, 1798, "St. Jean d'Acre will be attacked by sea.
I have Bonaparte's letter before me."
<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> As the best port
and the best fortress on the coast, Acre was the bridgehead
into Palestine. To Syria it bore the relation that Lisbon
did to the Spanish Peninsular War. If Bonaparte advanced,
leaving it unsubdued, his flank and rear would through it
be open to attack from the sea. If it fell, he had good
reason to believe the country would rise in his favor. "If
I succeed," said he at a late period of the siege, when hope
had not yet abandoned him, "I shall find in the city the
treasures of the Pasha, and arms for three hundred thousand
men. I raise and arm all Syria, so outraged by the
ferocity of Djezzar, for whose fall you see the population
praying to God at each assault. I march upon Damascus
and Aleppo. I swell my army, as I advance, by all malcontents.
I reach Constantinople with armed masses. I
overthrow the Turkish Empire. I found in the East a new
and great empire which shall fix my place in posterity."
<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
Dreams? Ibrahim Pasha advanced from Egypt in 1831,
took Acre in 1832, and marched into the heart of Asia
Minor, which the battle of Konieh soon after laid at his
feet; why not Bonaparte? Damascus had already offered
him its keys, and the people were eager for the overthrow
of the pashas.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March Sir Sidney Smith himself left the
blockade of Alexandria, and on the 15th anchored with the
"Tigre" off Acre. He found that much had already been
done, by Phélippeaux and the "Theseus," to make the obsolete
fortifications more fit to withstand the approaching
siege. Sending the "Theseus" now to cruise down the coast
towards Jaffa, it fell to himself to deal the heaviest and
most opportune blow to Bonaparte's projects. Some light
coasters had sailed with a siege train from the Damietta
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
(eastern) mouth of the Nile, which the British never had
ships enough to blockade. On the morning of the 18th they
were seen approaching Acre, under convoy of a small corvette.
The "Tigre" at once gave chase, and captured all but
the corvette and two of the coasters. The cannon that
should have been turned against the walls were landed and
served to defend them; while the prizes, receiving British
crews, thenceforth harassed the siege works, flanking the
two walls against which the attacks were addressed, and
enfilading the trenches. The French, having by this
mishap lost all their siege guns proper, had to depend upon
field-pieces to breach the walls until the 25th of April, when
half a dozen heavy cannon were received from Jaffa.
<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> This
time was simply salvation to the besieged and ruin to the
assailants; for, in the interval, the skill of Phélippeaux
and the diligence of the men under him prepared the place
to withstand attacks which at an early period would have
caused its fall.</p>

<p>Into the details of this siege, petty in itself but momentous
in its bearing upon events, it will not be expected that
this work shall enter. The crucial incident was the capture
of the siege train and the precious respite thus obtained.
Orders were indeed sent to Rear-Admiral Perrée to come
as speedily as possible, with his small squadron of three
frigates and two corvettes, to Jaffa and land guns; but
Alexandria was already blockaded, and, from the narrowness
of the entrance, very difficult to leave in face of a foe.
On the 5th of April, however, the blockading force had to
go to Cyprus for water,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and on the 8th Perrée got away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
On the 15th he landed at Jaffa six ship's guns, and so much
ammunition as left his little squadron with only fifteen
rounds. He then received orders to cruise to the westward
of Acre and intercept the communications of the Turks
with Candia and Rhodes. Returning from this duty on the
14th of May, he was seen and chased by the "Theseus."
An accidental explosion on board the latter forced her to give
over pursuit; but Perrée, recognizing the danger of capture,
and being short of water and supplies, determined to go to
France, as his instructions allowed in case of necessity.
On the 17th of June, when only sixty miles from Toulon,
he met a British fleet, by which all five vessels were taken.</p>

<p>On the 4th of May, when the besieged and besiegers had
been mining, countermining, and daily fighting, for over six
weeks—separated by but a stone's throw one from the
other—a breach thought practicable by the French general
was made, the mine for blowing in the counterscarp was
finished, and a general assault was ordered for the 5th; but
the engineers of the besieged countermined so industriously
that by daybreak they had ruined the mine before being
discovered. This caused the assault to be postponed to the
9th. On the 7th, towards evening, some thirty or forty sail
were seen on the western horizon. They bore the long
expected Turkish succors from Rhodes; whose commander
even now had only been induced to approach by a peremptory
exercise of Sir Sidney Smith's powers as British minister.
Bonaparte saw that no more time could be lost, and
ordered the assault at once; the weather being calm,
twenty-four hours might still elapse before the re-enforcements
could enter the place. Under a heavy fire from one
side and the other, the attack was made; and in the morning
the British seamen saw the French flag flying on the
outer angle of one of the towers. It marked the high water
of Bonaparte's Syrian expedition.</p>

<p>On the 8th the assault was renewed. As the French
columns advanced, the Turkish ships were still detained in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the offing by calms, and the soldiers were being brought
ashore in boats, but still far from the landing. Then it
was that Sir Sidney Smith, seeing that a few critical
moments might determine the success or failure of his
weary struggle, manned the boats of his ships, and pulling
rapidly ashore led the British seamen, armed with pikes, to
help hold the breach till the troops could arrive. The
French carried the first line, the old fortifications of the
town; but that done, they found themselves confronted
with a second, which Phélippeaux, now dead, had formed
by connecting together the houses and garden walls of the
seraglio within. The strife raged throughout the day, with
varied success in different quarters; but at nightfall, after
a struggle of twenty-four hours, the assailants withdrew
and Acre was saved. On the 20th the siege was raised,
the French retreating during the night. Upon the 25th
they reached Jaffa, and on the 29th Gaza. Both places
were evacuated; and the army, resuming its march, next
day entered the desert. On the 2d of June it encamped in
the oasis of El Arish. The garrison of the fort there was
re-enforced, the works strengthened with more artillery,
and the place provisioned for six months. It was the one
substantial result of the Syrian expedition,—an outpost
which, like Acre, an invader must subdue before advancing.
On the 7th, after nine days' march through the desert
under the scorching heat of the June sun, the army re-entered
Egypt. It had lost since its departure fifteen
hundred killed or dead of disease, and more than two thousand
wounded.</p>

<p>The reputation of Sir Sidney Smith with posterity rests
upon the defence of Acre, in which he made proof of solid
as well as brilliant qualities. Bonaparte, who never forgave
the check administered to his ambition, nor overcame
the irritation caused by sixty days fretting against an unexpected
and seemingly trivial obstacle, tried hard to decry
the character of the man who thwarted him. "Smith is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
lunatic," he said, "who wishes to make his fortune and
keep himself always before the eyes of the world. He is a
man capable of any folly, to whom no profound or rational
project is ever to be attributed."
<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> "Sir Sidney Smith occupied
himself too much with the detail of affairs on shore,
which he did not understand, and where he was of little
use; he neglected the maritime business, which he did
understand, and where he had everything in his power."
This accusation was supported by the circumstantial mis-statement
that six big guns, with a large quantity of ammunition
and provisions, were landed by Perrée, undetected,
seven miles from Smith's ships.
<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>That there was a strong fantastic and vainglorious strain
in Smith's character seems certain, and to it largely he
owed the dislike of his own service; but so far as appears,
he showed at Acre discretion and sound judgment, as well
as energy and courage. It must be remembered, in justice,
that all power and all responsibility were in his hands, and
that the result was an eminent success. Under the circumstances
he had to be much on shore as well as afloat;
but he seems to have shown Phélippeaux, and after the latter's
death, Colonel Douglas, the confidence and deference
which their professional skill demanded, as he certainly
was most generous in recognizing their services and those
of others. When the equinoctial gales came on he remained
with his ship, which had to put to sea; an act which
Bonaparte maliciously attributed to a wish to escape the
odium of the fall of the place. Whether ashore or afloat,
Smith could not please Bonaparte. The good sense which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
defers to superior experience, the lofty spirit which bears
the weight of responsibility and sustains the courage of
waverers, ungrudging expenditure of means and effort, unshaken
determination to endure to the end, and heroic
inspiration at the critical moment of the last assault,—all
these fine qualities must in candor be allowed to Sir
Sidney Smith at the siege of Acre. He received and
deserved the applause, not only of the multitude and the
government, but of Nelson himself. The deeds of Acre
blotted out of memory the exaggerated reports of the almost
total destruction of the French fleet at his hands
when Toulon was evacuated; reports which had left upon
his name the imputation of untrustworthiness. But,
whatever the personal merits of Sir Sidney Smith in this
memorable siege, there can be no doubt that to the presence
of the British ships, and the skilled support of the British
officers, seamen, and marines—manning the works—is to
be attributed the successful resistance made by the brave,
but undisciplined Turks.</p>

<p>During the last days of the siege of Acre and while
Bonaparte was leading his baffled army through the sands
of the desert back into Egypt, the western Mediterranean
was thrown into a ferment by the escape of the French fleet
from Brest. This very remarkable episode, having led to
no tangible results, has been little noticed by general historians;
but to the student of naval war its incidents are
most instructive. It is scarcely too much to say that never
was there a greater opportunity than that offered to the
French fleet, had it been a valid force, by the scattered condition
of its enemies on this occasion; nor can failure
deprive the incident of its durable significance, as illustrating
the advantage, to the inferior navy, of a large force
concentrated in a single port, when the enemy, though superior,
is by the nature of the contest compelled to disseminate
his squadrons. The advantage is greatest when the
port of concentration is central with reference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
enemy's positions; but is by no means lost when, as was then
the case with Brest, it is at one extremity of the theatre of
war. It was a steady principle in the policy of Napoleon,
when consul and emperor, to provoke dissemination of the
British navy by threatening preparations at widely separated
points of his vast dominions; just as it was a
purpose of the British government, though not consistently
followed, to provoke France to ex-centric efforts by naval
demonstrations, menacing many parts of the shore line.
The Emperor, however, a master of the art of war and an
adept at making the greatest possible smoke with the least
expenditure of fuel, was much more than a match in the
game of deception for the unmilitary and many-headed
body that directed the affairs of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Although in 1799 the Channel fleet had attached to it as
many as fifty-one ships-of-the-line,
<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> of which forty-two
upon the alarm that ensued very soon got to sea,
<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Lord
Bridport had with him but sixteen when he took command
off Brest, on the 17th of April, relieving the junior admiral
who, with eight or nine ships, had done the winter
cruising. On the 25th Bridport looked into the port and
saw there eighteen ships-of-the-line ready for sea. The
wind being fresh at north-east, the British admiral stood
out until he reached a position twelve miles west-south-west
of Ushant Island. The entrance being thus clear and the
wind fair, the French fleet, numbering twenty-five of the
line and ten smaller vessels, slipped out that night under
command of Admiral Bruix, then minister of marine, who,
by his close official relations to the government, was indicated
as a proper person to fulfil an apparently confidential
mission, for which his professional ability and activity
eminently fitted him.</p>

<p>Being bound south and the wind favoring, Bruix passed
through the southern passage, known as the Passage du
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Raz,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
distant thirty miles or more from the spot where Bridport
had stationed his fleet, which consequently saw nothing,
though it had great reason to suspect a movement by
the French. At 9 <span class="sc">A. M.</span> on the 26th, however, a British
inshore frigate caught sight of the enemy just as the last
ships were passing through the Raz, and hastened toward
her fleet. At noon she lost sight of the French, and an
hour later, the signal being repeated from vessel to vessel,
Bridport learned that the enemy were out. He at once
made sail for Brest, assured himself on the 27th that the
news was true, and then steered for Ireland to cover it
from a possible invasion, sending at the same time warning
to Keith off Cadiz and to St. Vincent at Gibraltar, as well
as orders into the Channel ports for all ships to join him off
Cape Clear. The whole south coast of England was at
once in an uproar; but the government, knowing how scattered
were the vessels in the Mediterranean, had a double
anxiety. On the 6th of May, five ships-of-the-line sailed
from Plymouth to join St. Vincent.
<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The rest of the
Channel fleet got off as fast as they could to Bridport, who,
in spite of the reports from merchant vessels that had seen
the French to the southward, and steering south, refused to
believe that Ireland was safe. In this delusion he was confirmed
by a barefaced and much-worn ruse, a small French
vessel being purposely allowed to fall into his hands with
dispatches for Ireland. On the 12th of May there remained
in Plymouth but a single ship-of-the-line, and that detained
by sickness among the crew,—"a circumstance
scarcely ever remembered before."
<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Despite this accumulation
of force, it was not till June 1 that Bridport
detached to the southward sixteen sail-of-the-line,
<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> of which
twelve went on to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 3d of May Admiral Keith, off
Cadiz, was joined by a British frigate chased the day before
by Bruix's fleet, of which she had lost sight only at 4 <span class="sc">P.
M.</span> The next morning the French appeared, twenty-four
ships to the British fifteen, which were to leeward of their
enemy. The wind, that had been blowing fresh from north-west
since the day before, rapidly increased to a whole
gale, so that though there were nineteen Spanish ships
in Cadiz and twenty-four French outside, the British remained
safe; and not only so, but by making it impossible
for the French to enter without an engagement, prevented
this first attempt at a junction. "Lord Keith," wrote St.
Vincent, "has shown great manhood and ability, his position
having been very critical, exposed to a hard gale of
wind, blowing directly on shore, with an enemy of superior
force to windward, and twenty-two ships-of-the-line in Cadiz
ready to profit by any disaster that might have befallen
him."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Bruix, who knew that his captains, long confined
to port by the policy of their government, were not able to
perform fleet manœuvres in ordinary weather, dared not
attack on a lee shore with a wind that would tax all the
abilities of experienced seamen.
<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> He therefore kept away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
again to the south-east, determining to lose no time, but at
once to enter the Mediterranean; and the following day
Lord St. Vincent, gazing from the rock of Gibraltar through
the thick haze that spread over the Straits, saw, running
before the gale, a number of heavy ships which, from dispatches
received the day before, he knew must be French.</p>

<p>The situations of the vessels in his extensive command,
as present that morning to the mind of the aged earl, must
be realized by the reader if he would enter into the embarrassment
and anxiety of the British commander-in-chief,
or appreciate the military significance of Bruix's appearance,
with a large concentrated force, in the midst of dispositions
taken without reference to such a contingency.
The fifteen ships off Cadiz, with one then lying at Tetuan,
on the Morocco side of the Straits, where the Cadiz ships
went for water, were the only force upon which St. Vincent
could at once depend, and if they were called off the
Spanish fleet was released. At Minorca, as yet imperfectly
garrisoned,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
was an isolated body of four ships under
Commodore Duckworth. Lord Nelson's command in the
central Mediterranean was disseminated, and the detachments,
though not far out of supporting distance, were
liable to be separately surprised. Troubridge with four
vessels was blockading Naples, now in possession of the
French, and at the same time co-operating with the resistance
made to the foreign intruders by the peasantry under
Cardinal Ruffo. Nelson himself, with one ship, was at Palermo,
and the faint-hearted court and people were crying
that if he left them the island was lost. Captain Ball,
with three of the line, blockaded Malta, the only hope of
subduing which seemed to be by rigorous isolation. Far to
the eastward, up the Mediterranean, without a friendly port
in which to shelter, Sidney Smith with two ships, unsuspicious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
of danger from the sea, was then drawing to an end
the defence of Acre.</p>

<p>Each of these British divisions lay open to the immensely
superior force which Bruix brought. Not only so, but the
duties of an important nature to which each of them was
assigned were threatened with frustration. So large a fleet
as that of Bruix might, and according to the usual French
practice probably would, have numerous troops embarked.
<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
No amount of skill could rescue Troubridge's division from
such a disproportion of force, and with it would fall the resistance
of Naples. Only flight could save the ships off
Malta, and St. Vincent saw the blockade raised, the garrison
re-enforced and re-victualled; as within his own memory
had so often been done for Gibraltar, in its famous
siege not twenty years before. Duckworth's little squadron
could not prevent the landing of an army which would
sweep Minorca again into the hands of Spain, and the British
commodore might consider himself fortunate if, in so
difficult a dilemma, he extricated his ships from a harbor
always hard to leave.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
Spain also had in Cartagena and
Majorca a number of soldiers that could be rapidly thrown
into Minorca under cover of such a fleet.</p>

<p>The British admiral instantly decided to sacrifice all
other objects to the concentration of his fleet in such a
position as should prevent the junction of the French and
Spaniards; against which the presence off Cadiz of Keith's
squadron, though inferior in numbers to either, had so far
effectually interposed. He at once sent off dispatches to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
all his lieutenants; but the westerly gales that were driving
Bruix to his goal made it impossible to get ship or boat
to Keith. This admiral was only reached by an indulgence
from the Spanish officials, between whom and the British
an intercourse of courtesy was steadily maintained. These
granted to Admiral Coffin, who had been appointed to a post
in Halifax, passports to proceed to Lisbon through Spain;
and Coffin on the way contrived to get a boat sent off to
Keith, with orders which brought him to Gibraltar on the
10th. To Nelson the earl wrote that he believed the enemy
were bound to Malta and Alexandria; and that the Spaniards,
whom he was forced to release from Cadiz, would
descend upon Minorca. Nelson received this message on
the 13th of May. The day before, a brig coming direct
from the Atlantic without stopping at Gibraltar had notified
him of the escape from Brest, and that the French had
been seen steering south. On the strength of this he drew
from Naples and Malta all the ships-of-the-line except one
before each, directing a rendezvous off Port Mahon, where
he would join Duckworth; but when St. Vincent's letter
came, he called them all in, leaving only frigates on each
station, and ordered the heavy vessels to meet him off the
island of Maritimo, to intercept the French between Sicily
and Africa. He also sent to Duckworth to ask his help;
but the commodore declined until he could communicate
with the commander-in-chief, from whom he had received
orders to keep his division in readiness to join the main
fleet when it appeared.</p>

<p>St. Vincent's position, in truth, was one of utter and dire
perplexity. If the French and Spaniards got together, he
would have forty-four enemy's vessels on his hands; against
which, by sacrificing every other object, he could only
gather thirty until re-enforced by the Channel fleet, upon
whose remissness he could hardly fail to charge his false
position. To lose Minorca and Sicily, to see Malta snatched
from his fingers when ready to close upon it, the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
position in Naples established, and that in Egypt so strengthened
as to become impregnable to either attack or reduction
by want, such were the obvious probable consequences of
Bruix's coming. Besides these evident dangers, he very
well knew from secret official information that the Spanish
court were in constant dread of a popular insurrection,
which would give the French a pretext for entering the
peninsula,—not, as in 1808, to impose a foreign king upon
an unwilling nation, but to promote a change in the government
which the distress of the people, though usually loyal,
would probably welcome. In March he had received a
communication from the Spanish prime minister, asking
that a British frigate might be detailed to bring remittances
from the Spanish colonies to Gibraltar, to be afterwards
conveyed into Spain. The reason given for making this request
of an enemy was that the want of specie, and consequent
delay in public payments, especially to the soldiery,
made revolution imminent. St. Vincent recommended his
government to comply, because of the danger, in case of
disturbances, that both Spain and Portugal might fall under
subjection to France.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately, amid the conflicting claims of diverse interests,
the path of military wisdom was perfectly clear to one
understanding its principles. St. Vincent might be agitated
by apprehensions; but he knew what he must do, and
did it. To get his own fleet together and at the same time
prevent the allies from uniting theirs, was the first thing;
and the point of concentration indicated for this purpose
should be one that would cover Minorca, if he arrived before
it was reduced. For Sicily, Malta, and all to the eastward,
he must trust to the transcendent abilities of Nelson and
his "band of brothers."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> On the 12th, after two days of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
hurried preparations, the British fleet sailed from Gibraltar.
On the 20th it reached Minorca, found it still safe, and was
joined by Duckworth's division, raising the force to twenty
ships-of-the-line. St. Vincent here received information
that the French had on the 12th been seen north of Minorca,
heading for Toulon.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Sending this news to Nelson he
sailed on the 22d in pursuit; but learning that the Spaniards
after Keith's departure had left Cadiz, as he had expected,
he decided to cruise off Cape San Sebastian on the Spanish
coast. Seventeen sail of Spaniards had indeed reached
Cartagena on the 20th; but in the passage from Cadiz
eleven had been partly or totally dismasted, and this circumstance
was sufficient excuse for not proceeding to a
junction, to which the policy of their court was but little
inclined.</p>

<p>On the 30th of May St. Vincent heard that the French
had sailed again from Toulon, but for what purpose was not
known. As it might follow the course of Bonaparte's expedition,
east of Corsica, and fall upon Sicily and Malta,
he sent Duckworth with four ships to Nelson at Palermo,
and four hours later was joined by the first detachment of
five sail-of-the-line from the Channel,
<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> of whose nearness he
doubtless had some intimation before parting with Duckworth.
With twenty-one sail he now stood south-west
toward Barcelona, then north-east for Toulon. On the 2d
of June, when seventy miles from this port, his health gave
way altogether. He turned over the command to Keith
and departed to Port Mahon.</p>

<p>Keith continued steering to the northward and eastward.
On the 5th of June he was joined by a small cruiser, which
had seen the French fleet in Vado Bay the day before.
Bruix had reached Toulon May 14, and sailed again on
the 26th, taking with him twenty-two ships; the others
being left in port for repairs. He steered east, carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
supplies and a few recruits for the army of Italy. On the
4th of June he had anchored in Vado Bay. A detachment
from the fleet threw the supplies into Genoa, and it would
seem that Bruix there had an interview with General
Moreau, then commanding the army of Italy. On the 6th,
<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
turning short round, he doubled on his tracks, following
close along the coast of Piedmont and Provence to avoid
the British,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
passed again in sight of Toulon to obtain information,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
and from there pushed on to Cartagena, where he
anchored on the 22d; thus making with the Spanish fleet
the junction which had been frustrated before Cadiz.</p>

<p>On the same day that Bruix turned, Lord Keith, who
had also passed close along the French coast between
Cannes and Nice,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
standing to the eastward, reached as far
as Monaco. Then the wind shifted to the eastward, and he
wrote as follows to Nelson: "Soon after I despatched the
'Telegraph'" (the vessel which saw the French in Vado
Bay) "last night, <i>the wind came fresh from the east</i>, which
is of course a fair wind for the enemy, if bound towards
you" (by the east of Corsica) "and a foul wind for me to
follow them, which is unfortunate; for, if my information
was just, I had no doubt of overtaking them before they had
left the coast of Italy; ... but <i>the defenceless state of
Minorca</i>, without a fleet, the great force prepared (at Cartagena)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
to attack it, added to my having so far exceeded
my orders already, will oblige me to relinquish the pursuit,
and return to the protection of that island. But I have
detached to your lordship the 'Bellerophon' and 'Powerful'
(seventy-fours), which I hope will arrive in time, as I
am confident <i>the French are not thirty leagues hence at this
moment</i>."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Being close in with the shore with an east wind, Keith
could only stand off on the port tack, and it would appear
that he still clung to the hope of a shift favorable for
reaching Bruix; for on the 8th he was sixty miles south
of Monaco,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
not on the route for Minorca. There he received
from St. Vincent, who, though relinquishing the
immediate command of the fleet, retained that of the station,
pressing orders to take a position off the Bay of
Rosas. This was evidently intended to block the junction
of the two fleets, though St. Vincent could not have known
Bruix's purpose to return. Keith did not obey the order;
but seems under its influence to have abandoned definitively
his hope of overtaking the French, for he made sail for
Minorca, and arrived there on the 12th.
<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Had he obeyed
St. Vincent he could scarcely have failed to meet Bruix,
for at the moment of receiving his letter the two fleets were
hardly sixty miles apart, and both would have passed within
sight of Cape San Sebastian, the natural landfall of vessels
going from Toulon to Cartagena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>Keith remained at Minorca but a few days, during which
St. Vincent turned over to him the command of the station
as well as of the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> He sailed again on the 15th for
Toulon; but the British had completely lost trace of the
French from the time that they surrendered the touch of
them obtained on the 5th of the month. From the 15th
of June to the 6th of July<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> was passed groping blindly in
the seas between Minorca, Toulon, and Genoa. On the
latter date Keith regained Minorca, and there found the
twelve ships-of-the-line which Bridport had detached from
Ireland on the 1st of June, and which seem to have reached
Port Mahon about the 17th of that month.
<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Scarcely an
hour after his arrival,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> information was received of the
French having entered Cartagena. The ships that had
accompanied Keith on the recent three weeks' cruise had to
fill with water; but on the 10th he started for the Straits
of Gibraltar with thirty-one ships-of-the-line, on a stern
chase—proverbially a long chase—after the allies, known
to be bound to the westward.</p>

<p>The latter, however, had a long start. Bruix, aware of
the reluctance of the Spaniards, and secretly informed that
in case of attack they could not be depended upon, hurried
them away after a week's waiting, in virtue of stringent
orders wrung from Madrid by the persistence of the French
ambassador. On the 29th of June he sailed, having sixteen
Spanish ships-of-the-line in company. On the 7th of July,
just as Keith reached Minorca from his profitless cruise off
Toulon, the allies were passing the Straits; and it happened,
somewhat singularly, that the old Earl of St. Vincent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
who had seen them pass Gibraltar, bound in, had
arrived in a frigate twenty-four hours before,—just in time
to hear their guns as they went out. They entered Cadiz
on the 11th of July, the day after Keith sailed in pursuit
from Minorca. On the 21st, still numbering forty sail,
they sailed from Cadiz, and on the 30th Keith with his
thirty-one passed the Straits, after a moment's delay at
Gibraltar. The British pressed their chase, and, despite
its long start, came off Brest barely twenty-four hours after
the French and Spaniards, who entered the port on the
13th of August. Lord Keith then went on to Torbay. The
news of the junction of the French and Spaniards, and of
their entering the Atlantic, had preceded him, and caused
a renewal of the excitement about intended invasion to
which Great Britain at this epoch was always prone. The
arrival of the large force under his command restored confidence;
but although, in conjunction with the Channel
fleet, there were now as many as fifty-six ships-of-the-line
assembled in Torbay, some time elapsed before the country
would part with any of them, while so many enemies lay
in Brest. Keith did not return to the Mediterranean until
December, the chief command there being exercised by
Nelson during his absence.</p>

<p>The exact aims of the French in this cruise, which from
the inefficiency of their officers and seamen was as hazardous
in its undertaking as it proved barren of results, have
never been precisely ascertained. This uncertainty is
probably due to the fact that the Directory itself was not
clear as to what could be accomplished, and that Bruix
had somewhat unlimited powers, based upon his confidential
knowledge of the views of the government. It would
seem that the first object, both in importance and in order,
was a junction with the Spaniards in Cadiz. This being
frustrated by Keith's division and by Bruix's distrust of
the efficiency of his captains, the opportunities for offensive
action, offered by the scattered condition of the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
ships, were neglected in favor of going to Toulon; for
Bruix seems to have neither felt nor betrayed any doubt as
to his course. "The Brest squadron had such a game to
play at Malta and Sicily," wrote St. Vincent to the First
Lord, "that I trembled for the fate of our ships employed
there, and for the latter island. Your lordship made a
better judgment by fixing their operations to the coast of
Genoa."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
As a matter of fact, this is true; but as a question
of military forecast, St. Vincent was perfectly right,
and the action of the French can only be explained on the
ground of distrust of their navy, or by the old faulty
policy—traditional in all French governments, republican,
royal, or imperial—of preferring ulterior objects to the
destruction of the enemy's ships.</p>

<p>That the relief or re-enforcement of Bonaparte was intended
seems improbable; although both St. Vincent and
Nelson entertained this suspicion, upon which the latter
acted. M. Thiers, indeed, finds Bruix's cruise inexplicable
on any other supposition, but he does not assert the fact.
<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
The feelings of the Directory towards that general were
not strictly benevolent, and the ships carried neither troops
nor supplies of importance; but the destruction of Nelson's
scattered detachments, coupled as that might have been
with the victualling of Malta, would have been a most
worthy object, and one of very probable fulfilment. It is
noteworthy that Nelson received his first news of Bruix's
approach on the 12th of May, at Palermo, and on the 14th
the French admiral entered Toulon. Now the distance
from Gibraltar to Toulon is only one hundred and fifty miles
less than that from Gibraltar to Palermo. Nelson could
not have collected his ships in time to present a united
front; and even could he, his whole force did not exceed
ten or twelve to the enemy's twenty-four. As it was,
Bruix's adventure, though daring in conception and active
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
in execution, resulted merely in bringing back to France
sixteen Spanish ships-of-the-line to be hostages for the
continuance of the Spanish alliance, tottering under the
adverse events of 1799; and this possibly was the great
purpose of the Directory. If so, the excursion was political
rather than military; and hence an opportunity, of a
kind which, when rightly improved, has always been most
pregnant of military consequences—concentration opposed
to dispersion—remains to us merely an impressive lesson
of what might have been, but was not. "Your lordship,"
wrote Nelson four years later to St. Vincent, "knows what
Admiral Bruix might have done had he done his duty."
<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
"The cruise of Admiral Bruix," says Captain Chevalier,
<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
"was well conceived, but failed through the weakness of
our allies and the inexperience of our own officers and
crews.... The Spanish squadron brought to Brest, the
gage of an alliance then very tottering, was the only result
of this campaign. It is impossible to have any illusion as
to the extent of the services rendered by the fleet on the
coast of Italy. A division of frigates would have done as
much."</p>

<p>The conduct of the British admirals in the Mediterranean,
caught at so serious a disadvantage through no fault
of their own, deserves to be considered. Dispersed in a
fashion that was perfectly proper and efficient under the
previous conditions, the arrival of Bruix imposed concentration,
with a consequent enforced abandonment of some
positions. St. Vincent's first step was to order Nelson to
concentrate in the neighborhood of Sicily, while he himself
drew Keith and Duckworth together at Minorca. This effected,
the British would present two squadrons; one of
twenty ships-of-the-line in the west, centring about Minorca;
the other, four hundred miles distant, of fifteen or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
sixteen ships,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
gathered off the west end of Sicily to dispute
the passage to Malta and Alexandria. This smaller
division thus seems to have been much exposed; but, independently
of its greatly superior efficiency to the French,
it must be remembered that St. Vincent, as soon as he
reached Minorca, knew that Nelson was in no immediate
danger, for the French had given him the go-by and gone
to Toulon. Cruising therefore off Cape San Sebastian, to
intercept the junction of the Spaniards to the French, he
was in constant touch of Minorca, barely one hundred
miles distant, and, at the same time, was as near to Nelson
as were the French in Toulon, whether they went east or
west of Corsica. Being only one hundred and twenty
miles from Toulon, and in such a position that a wind fair
for the French to sail was also fair to bring his lookouts
down to him, he could hope to overtake them,—if not in
time to save Nelson, yet with the certainty of finding the
French so badly handled that they could scarcely escape
him. He no doubt reasoned as did Nelson to the ministry
just before Trafalgar: "I ventured without any fear [to
predict] that if Calder [with eighteen ships] got fairly
alongside their twenty-seven or twenty-eight sail, by the time
the enemy had beat our fleet soundly, they would do us no
harm this year."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Save Malta, which could not have
maintained the twenty thousand men in their fleet for a
month and was otherwise barren of resources, the French
would have had no port to fall back on and would have
been lost to the republic.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Had St. Vincent cruised off
Cartagena, where the Spaniards were, he would have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
in better position to check them, but he would have uncovered
both Minorca and Nelson to the French; both
being nearer to Toulon than to Cartagena. Not only so,
but Cartagena being three hundred miles farther from Toulon
than Cape San Sebastian is, the British lookout ships
would have had all that greater distance to go to their admiral,
who, when found, would then be further from his
chief points of interest than when off the Cape. As soon,
however, as St. Vincent learned that the French had gone
east from Toulon, being relieved from any immediate apprehension
concerning the Spaniards, he re-enforced Nelson
with four ships, raising his squadron to sixteen British
against a possible French twenty-four.</p>

<p>It was during the week following the detachment to Nelson
that St. Vincent left the fleet, and that Keith made
the false move which has been so severely blamed. It appears
to the author, from all the information accessible to
him, that Keith took this step wholly independent of St.
Vincent's special orders, which are alleged as controlling
him. He acted in deference, partly, to the general orders
given before turning over the command, and partly to his
own views of the situation.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> These seem to have differed
from those of St. Vincent, who laid most stress on disabling
the enemy's fleets; whereas Keith was dominated
by the fear of losing Minorca. This feeling led him to
deviate from the order to cruise off the Gulf of Rosas, as
it also led him soon after, on two occasions, to direct Nelson
to detach ships for the defence of the island; which
Nelson, with very doubtful propriety, refused to do.
<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Minorca,
in this case, very appositely illustrates the embarrassment
of a fleet upon which an important seaport wholly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
depends for security. In the present instance the beating
of the French fleet and the protection of Minorca introduced
two apparently divergent motives, which became
personified in St. Vincent and his lieutenant. The former
saw the best protection to the island to be in beating the
fleet; Keith subordinated the latter to the former. With
St. Vincent agreed Nelson's simple but accurate view of
naval strategy: "I consider the best defence for his Sicilian
Majesty's dominions is to place myself alongside the
French."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
Keith, on the other hand, in a somewhat later
letter, expresses almost pathetically the embarrassment
caused by his inferior strategic insight. "It is very hard
I cannot find these vagabonds in some spot or other, and
that I am so <i>shackled</i> with this defenceless island."

Properly every seaport should be able to hold out for a
length of time, longer or shorter, according to its importance,
entirely independent of the fleet. The latter will
then be able to exert its great faculty, its mobility, unfettered
by considerations of what is happening at the port.
For so long the latter is safe; meanwhile the fleet may be
absent. The best coast-defence is a navy; not because
fortifications are not absolutely necessary, but because
beating the enemy's fleet is the best of all defences.</p>

<p>After the vain pursuit of Admiral Bruix, Lord Keith
brought his fleet into Torbay on the 17th of August. On
the 18th Earl St. Vincent landed at Portsmouth, thus formally
quitting the Mediterranean command, which he had
held for three years and nine months. Four days afterwards,
on the 22d of August, 1799, Bonaparte secretly
embarked at Alexandria to return into France.</p>

<p>After the Syrian campaign the French army had re-entered
Cairo on the 14th of June. On the 11th of July
Sir Sidney Smith, with his two ships, anchored in Aboukir
Bay, accompanying, or being accompanied by, a Turkish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
fleet of thirteen ships-of-the-line with a hundred other sail
of frigates and transports. Embarked on board the latter
were troops variously estimated at from ten to thirty thousand
men.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
On the 15th Bonaparte, at Cairo, learned that
his anticipations of an attack by sea, during the fine season,
had been realized. He promptly ordered Desaix to
evacuate upper Egypt for the security of Cairo, and rapidly
drew together in the neighborhood of Alexandria the detachments
in lower Egypt. This concentration was effected
on the 19th, but by that time the Turks had landed
and stormed the Castle of Aboukir, which fell on the 16th.
On the 25th the French attacked the enemy on the peninsula
of Aboukir, and the same scene that had witnessed
the destruction of Brueys's squadron a year before now
saw the entire overthrow of the Mahometan army. All
who had landed were either killed, driven into the sea and
drowned, or taken prisoners. Among the latter was the
Turkish commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>After the defeat flags of truce passed between Bonaparte
and the British commodore, through which the former received
English newspapers up to the 10th of June.
<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> By
them he learned the victorious advance of the second coalition,
and the defeats of the French in Germany and Italy.
His resolution was speedily taken to return to France. It
has been disputed whether this was a sudden determination
not before entertained, as asserted by his secretary Bourrienne;
or whether it represents a purpose gradually and
naturally formed. Napoleon himself in later years attributed
his decision to information obtained from Phélippeaux
in the trenches before Acre; when the combatants, separated
by but a few yards, often exchanged words.
<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> It is, however,
certain that the thought had long been familiar to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
him; for, in a letter to the Directory as early as October 7,
1798, he had announced his intention of returning to Europe
in certain very probable contingencies.
<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The same
message was repeated a few months later.
<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> In truth his
keen military sagacity, resembling the most delicate yet
most highly cultivated intuitions, had divined the misfortunes
awaiting France at the time he learned by the Ragusan
ship that Naples had declared war and that all
<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> the
powers were arming. During his own Italian campaign,
even after the British had left the Mediterranean, his mind
had been preoccupied with the danger from Naples; and
he foresaw in Egypt the disasters that must result from an
ex-centric movement of the French army in that quarter, if
followed by any reverses in upper Italy. Bourrienne tells
a story which illustrates vividly the superstitious vein in
his character, as well as the foreboding of evil that he had
carried with him into Syria. While before Acre, news was
received that a Nile boat named the "Italy," in the employ
of the French army, had after a gallant defence been blown
up by her crew to avoid capture by the Arabs. The incident
and the name made a strong impression upon Bonaparte.
"My friend," said he to Bourrienne, "Italy is lost
to France. All is over; my presentiments never deceive
me;" nor could any argument rid his mind of this conviction,
dependent rather upon his instinctive perceptions than
upon a slight and fortuitous coincidence.
<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> So, when he
read Sidney Smith's gazettes, he cried again: "My presentiment
did not deceive me! Italy is lost!"
<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Admiral Ganteaume was directed to prepare rapidly two
of the frigates which had fallen to France in her share of
the spoil of Venice; and the persons intended to accompany
the general were quietly notified. After the defeat of the
Turks at Aboukir, Sidney Smith had resumed the blockade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
of Alexandria; but on the 9th of August he withdrew to
Cyprus, probably for water. Taking advantage of the opportunity,
Bonaparte sailed, and after a tedious passage
landed at Fréjus on the 9th of October. One month later
the Directory was overthrown and the supreme power in
France passed into Bonaparte's hands.</p>

<p>Thus ended, so far at least as the great designer was concerned,
Bonaparte's Oriental Expedition; an undertaking
which has been freely stigmatized as a dream, marked by
the eccentricities of its author's genius, not by his usual
keen intelligence. A dream it was, it is true; but not for
its Eastern impossibilities, nor for its wide flights of imagination,
the faculty which Bonaparte possessed in so eminent
a degree, without which he never could have conceived his
extraordinary policy, and to which he usually joined a
width and depth of practical wisdom which balanced his
imagination and made possible the realizing of his visions.
That it was no dream to rouse and combine the nations of
the East under the headship of one man, witness the careers
of the adventurers who there, from age to age, have
risen to empire; and who certainly were not superior in
genius, nor as leaders of men, to the great Corsican. Witness,
too, the motley host which he gathered under one
standard, from all the highly organized nations of continental
Europe, for that other great Eastern expedition in
which he wrecked his fortunes. The Egyptian enterprise
and all its brilliant hopes definitively failed at Acre, in
the march against Turkey through Syria; and it failed,—why?
Because a British seaman, by his command of the
sea and his support to the garrison, maintained the possession
of a place, to advance beyond which, unsubdued, would
entail ruin. Forty years later an army, not of the superb
soldiers of the French revolution, but of native Egyptians,
led by Ibrahim Pasha, whom none will equal to Napoleon,
undertook the same march, captured Acre, and had progressed
victoriously into the heart of Asia Minor when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
British navy again interfered and called a halt. How came
it that a naval captain, with two ships-of-the-line and a few
small vessels, controlled absolutely the far east of the Mediterranean?
Because in Aboukir Bay, nine months before,
Nelson had destroyed the French fleet. That magnificent
battle not only signalized the genius for war of the British
admiral, but proclaimed aloud the existence of a power
destined ever, and in all parts, to clip the wings of the
coming emperor. The Eastern enterprise of Bonaparte
failed, not because of miscalculations as to what was possible
in that far East, which Western people so ill can understand;
but because he, to the end of his career, was never
able rightly to appreciate the conditions of naval warfare.
His perfect military insight was not mistaken in affirming
that the principles of war upon the sea must be the same
as upon land; it was by the failure to comprehend the circumstances
to which the principles must be applied—the
failure to realize the possibilities and the limitations of the
naval warfare of his day—that the general and the emperor
were alike led into fatal miscalculations. The Nile and
Trafalgar, each the grave of a great conception, proclaimed
the same cause and the same effect; underlying each was
the inability of Napoleon to understand what ships could
do and what they could not, according to the conditions of
the sea and the capacity of the seamen.</p>

<p>There was, however, one radical fallacy underlying
Bonaparte's Egyptian, or rather Oriental, expedition,—for
in his mind it far outleaped the narrow limits of the
Nile valley,—and that lay in the effect he expected
to produce upon Great Britain. It is all very well to
stigmatize, after Lanfrey's fashion, as the vagaries of a
distempered fancy, the vast projects of Eastern conquest
and dominion, which unquestionably filled his mind with
dreams of a sweep to his arms rivalling that of Alexander
and of the Roman legions. An extraordinary,
perhaps even an extravagant, imagination was one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the necessary conditions of Napoleon's wonderful career.
That it should from time to time lead him into great mistakes,
and ultimately to his ruin, was perhaps inevitable.
Without it, or with it in a markedly less degree,
he might have died in his palace an old man and left his
throne to a son, if not to a dynasty; but also without it he
would not have produced upon his own age and upon all
subsequent history the effects which he has left. To it
were due the Oriental visions, to which, regarded as a military
enterprise, the present writer is certainly not ready to
apply the word "fantastic." But, as a blow directed against
Great Britain, there was in them a fatal defect of conception,
due more to a miscalculation of the intellect, a prejudice
of his day, than to a wild flight of fancy.</p>

<p>In the relations of India to Great Britain, Bonaparte, in
common with all Frenchmen of his age, mistook effect for
cause. The possession of India and of other colonies was
to them the cause of British prosperity; just as at a later
time, and now, the wide extent of British commerce has
seemed to many the cause of Great Britain's wealth and
eminence among the nations. That there is truth in this
view is not to be denied; but it is the kind of truth compatible
with putting the cart before the horse, mistaking
the fruit for the tree, the flower for the plant. There was
less excuse for a blunder of this kind in a quick-witted
nation like the French, for they had before their eyes the
fact that they had long owned some of the richest colonies
in the world; and yet the British had, upon their own
ground, amid all disadvantages of position, absorbed the
commerce of the West Indies, French as well as Spanish.
In local advantages, Great Britain in the West Indies had
not the tenth of what France and Spain had; yet she so
drank the wealth of the region that one fourth of her
envied commerce then depended upon it. So in India;
Great Britain sucked the wealth of India, because of the
energy and commercial genius of her people. Had Bonaparte's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
visions been realized and India dominated, Great
Britain would not have been overcome. A splendid bough
would have been torn from a tree, and, in falling, would
have carried to the ground the fruit depending from it;
but not only was the amount of the fruit exaggerated, but
the recuperative power of the root, the aptitude of the
great trunk to throw out new branches, was not understood.
Had Bonaparte converted the rule of India from
England to France, he would have embarrassed, not destroyed,
British traffic therein. Like the banyan tree, a
new sucker would have been thrown out and reached the
soil in some new spot, defying efforts at repression; as
British commerce later refused to die under the far more
searching efforts of the Continental System.</p>

<p>The strength of Great Britain could be said to lie in her
commerce only as, and because, it was the external manifestation
of the wisdom and strength of the British people,
unhampered by any control beyond that of a government
and institutions in essential sympathy with them. In the enjoyment
of these blessings,—in their independence and untrammelled
pursuit of wealth,—they were secured by their
powerful navy; and so long as this breastplate was borne,
unpierced, over the heart of the great organism, over the
British islands themselves, Great Britain was—not invulnerable—but
invincible. She could be hurt indeed, but she
could not be slain. Herein was Bonaparte's error. His
attempt upon India was strategically a fine conception; it
was an attack upon the flank of an enemy whose centre
was then too strong for him; but as a broad effort of military
policy,—of statesmanship directing arms,—it was
simply delivering blows upon an extremity, leaving the
heart untouched. The same error pervaded his whole
career; for, with all his genius, he still was, as Thiers
has well said, the child of his century. So, in his
later years, he was beguiled into the strife wherein he
bruised Great Britain's heel, and she bruised his head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Yet his mistake, supreme genius that he was, is scarce
to be wondered at; for after all the story of his career, of
his huge power, of his unrelenting hostility, of his indomitable
energy, unremittingly directed to the destruction of
his chief enemy,—after all this and its failure,—we still
find men harping on the weakness of Great Britain through
her exposed commerce. Her dependence upon trade, and
the apparent slackening of the colonial ties, foretell her
fatal weakness in the hour of trial. So thought Napoleon;
so think we. Yet the commercial genius of her people is
not abated; and the most fruitful parts of that colonial
system existed scarcely, if at all, in those old days, when
her commerce was as great in proportion to her numbers
as it is now. To paralyze this, it must be taken by the
throat; no snapping at the heels will do it. To command
the sea approaches to the British islands will be to destroy
the power of the State; as a preliminary thereto the British
navy must be neutralized by superior numbers, or by
superior skill.</p>

<p>Like the furtive intrusion and hasty retreat of Bruix's
fleet, the stealthy manner of Bonaparte's return to Europe
proclaimed the control of the Mediterranean by the British
navy, and foretold the certain fall of his two great conquests,
Egypt and Malta. His own personal credit was too
deeply staked upon their deliverance, both by his original
responsibility for the expedition and by the promises of
succor made to the soldiers abandoned in Egypt, to admit a
doubt of his wish to save them, if it could be done. His
correspondence is full of the subject, and numerous efforts
were made; as great, probably, as were permitted by the
desperate struggle with external enemies and internal disorder
in which he found France plunged. All, however,
proved fruitless. The detailed stories of the loss of Egypt
and of Malta by France have much interest, both for the
military and unprofessional reader; but they are summed up
in the one fact which prophesied their fall: France had lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
all power to dispute the control of the sea. From February,
1799, when a small frigate entered La Valetta, to January,
1800, not a vessel reached the port. In the latter month a
dispatch-boat got in, bringing news of Bonaparte's accession
to power as First Consul; which event, though two
months old, was still unknown to the garrison. On the 6th
of February Admiral Perrée, who had served on the Nile
and in Syria to Bonaparte's great satisfaction, sailed from
Toulon with the "Généreux," seventy-four, one of the ships
that had escaped from Aboukir Bay, three smaller vessels,
and one large transport. A quantity of supplies and between
three and four thousand troops for the relief of
Malta were embarked in the squadron. On the 18th they
fell in with several British ships, under Nelson's immediate
command; and after the exchange of a few shots, one of
which killed Perrée, the "Généreux" and the transport
struck to a force too superior to be resisted. The other
ships returned to Toulon.</p>

<p>All further attempts to introduce relief likewise failed.
During the two years' blockade, from September, 1798, to
September, 1800, only five vessels succeeded in entering the
port.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
The "Guillaume Tell," which had lain in Valetta
harbor since the battle of the Nile, attempted to escape on
the night of the 31st of March, being charged with letters
to Bonaparte saying that the place could not hold out
longer than June. The ship was intercepted by the British,
and surrendered after a brilliant fight, in which all her
masts were shot away<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
and over a fifth of her crew killed
and wounded. One of the vessels sharing in this capture
was Lord Nelson's flag-ship, the "Foudroyant," but the
admiral himself was not on board. Swayed by a variety of
feelings, to analyze which is unnecessary and not altogether
pleasant to those who admire his fame, he had asked, after
the return of Lord Keith, to be relieved and granted a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
repose to which his long and brilliant services assuredly
entitled him. He thus failed to receive the surrender of
the last of the ships which escaped from the Nile, and to
accomplish the reduction of Malta, whose ultimate fate had
been determined by his previous career of victory. The
island held out until the 5th of September, 1800. Nelson
on the 11th of July struck his flag in Leghorn, and in company
with the Hamiltons went home overland, by way of
Trieste and Vienna, reaching England in November.</p>

<p>The story of Egypt is longer and its surrender was later,—due
also to force, not to starvation. An army powerful
enough to hold in submission and reap the use of the fertile
valley of the Nile, could never be reduced like the port of a
rocky island, blocked by sea and surrounded by a people in
successful insurrection. Nevertheless, the same cause that
determined the loss of Malta operated effectually to make
Egypt a worse than barren possession.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, though wielding uncontrolled sway over all
the resources of France, found as great difficulty in getting
news from his conquest or substantial succor to it as he
had had, when in Egypt, to obtain intelligence from home.
Unwearying official effort and lavish inducements to
private enterprise alike proved vain. In the first week of
September, 1800, the return of the "Osiris," a dispatch-boat
that had successfully made the round voyage between
France and Egypt, was rewarded by a gift of three thousand
dollars to the captain and two months' pay to the crew.
This extravagant recompense sufficiently testifies the difficulty
of the feat; and over seven weeks later, on October
29, Bonaparte writes to Menou, "We have no direct news of
you since the arrival of the 'Osiris.'" This letter was to be
entrusted to Admiral Ganteaume; but three months elapsed
before that officer was enabled by a violent gale to evade
the British blockade of Brest. Appeals were made to
Spain, and government agents sent throughout the south of
France, as well as to Corsica, to Genoa, to Leghorn, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Adriatic, to Taranto, when Italy after Marengo again fell
under Bonaparte's control. Numerous small vessels, both
neutral and friendly, were from every quarter to start for
Egypt, if by chance some of them might reach their destination;
but no substantial result followed. For the most
part they only swelled the list of captures, and attested the
absolute control of the sea by Great Britain.</p>

<p>Kleber, the illustrious general to whom Bonaparte left
the burden he himself dropped, in a letter which fell into
the hands of the British, addressed to the Directory the
following words:<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
"I know all the importance of the
possession of Egypt. I used to say in Europe that this
country was for France the fulcrum, by means of which
she might move at will the commercial system of every
quarter of the globe; but to do this effectually, a powerful
lever is required, and that lever is a Navy. Ours has
ceased to exist. Since that period everything has changed;
and peace with the Porte is, in my opinion, the only expedient
that holds out to us a method of fairly getting rid
of an enterprise no longer capable of attaining the object
for which it was undertaken."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> In other words, the
French force of admirable and veteran soldiers in Egypt
was uselessly locked up there; being unable either to
escape or to receive re-enforcement, they were lost to their
country. So thought Nelson, who frequently declared in
his own vehement fashion that not one should with his
consent return to Europe, and who gave to Sir Sidney
Smith most positive orders on no account to allow a single
Frenchman to leave Egypt under passports.
<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> So thought
Bonaparte, despite the censure which he and his undiscriminating
supporters have seen fit to pass upon Kleber.
Six weeks before he sailed for Europe
<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> he wrote to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Directory: "We need at least six thousand men to replace
our losses since landing in Egypt.... With fifteen
thousand re-enforcements we could go to Constantinople.
We should need, then, two thousand cavalry, six thousand
recruits for the regiments now here; five hundred artillerists;
five hundred mechanics (carpenters, masons, etc.);
five demi-brigades of two thousand men each; twenty
thousand muskets, forty thousand bayonets, etc. etc. <i>If
you cannot send us all this assistance it will be necessary to
make peace</i>; for, between this and next June, we may
expect to lose another six thousand men."
<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> But how was
this help to be sent when the sea was securely closed?</p>

<p>Bonaparte and Kleber held essentially the same view of
the situation; but the one was interested, like a bankrupt,
in concealing the state of affairs, the other was not.
Kleber therefore gladly closed with a proposition, made by
the Turks under the countenance of Sir Sidney Smith, who
still remained in the Levant, by which the French were to
be permitted to evacuate Egypt and to be carried to
France; Turkey furnishing such transports as were needed
beyond those already in Alexandria. A convention to this
effect was signed at El Arish on the 24th of January,
1800, by commissioners representing Kleber on the one
hand and the commander-in-chief of the Turks on the other.
The French army would thus be restored to France, under
no obligations that would prevent its at once entering the
field against the allies of Great Britain and Turkey. Sir
Sidney Smith did not sign; but it appears from his letter
of March 8, 1800,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
to M. Poussielgue, one of Kleber's commissioners,
that he was perfectly cognizant of and approving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
the terms of an agreement in direct contravention of
the treaty of alliance between Turkey and Great Britain,
and containing an article (the eleventh) engaging his government
to issue the passports and safe conducts for the
return of the French,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
which depended absolutely upon its
control of the sea, and which his own orders from his
superiors explicitly forbade.</p>

<p>The British government had meantime instructed Lord
Keith that the French should not be allowed to leave
Egypt, except as prisoners of war. On the 8th of January,
over a fortnight before the convention of El Arish was
signed, the admiral wrote from Port Mahon to notify Smith
of these directions, which were identical in spirit with those
he already had from Nelson. With this letter he enclosed
one to Kleber, "to be made use of if circumstances should
so require." This letter, cast in the peremptory tone probably
needed to repress Smith, informed Kleber curtly that
he had "received positive orders not to consent to any
capitulation of the French troops, unless they should lay
down their arms, surrender themselves prisoners of war,
and deliver up the ships and stores in Alexandria." Even
in this event they were not to be permitted to return to
France until exchanged. The admiral added that any vessel
with French troops on board, having passports "from
others than those authorized to grant them," would be
forced by British cruisers to return to Alexandria.
<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Smith,
knowing that he had exceeded his authority, had nothing
to do in face of this communication but to transmit the letters
apologetically to Kleber, expressing the hope that the
engagement allowed by him would ultimately be sustained.
In this he was not deceived. The British cabinet, learning
that Kleber had executed an essential part of his own
agreements, under the impression that Smith had authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
to pledge his government, sent other instructions to Keith,
authorizing the carrying out of the convention while expressly
denying Smith's right to accede to it. Owing to
the length of time required in that age for these communications
to pass back and forth, such action had been taken
by Kleber, before these new instructions were received, that
the convention never became operative. The French occupation
lingered on. Kleber, being assassinated on the 14th
of June, 1800, was succeeded by Menou, an incapable
man; and in March, 1801, a British army under General
Abercromby landed in Aboukir Bay. Abercromby was
mortally wounded on the 21st, at the battle of Alexandria;
but his successor was equal to the task before him, and in
September, 1801, shortly before the preliminaries of peace
with Great Britain were signed, the last of the French
quitted Egypt.</p>

<p>The terms under which the evacuation was made were
much the same as those granted at El Arish; but circumstances
had very greatly changed. The battle of Marengo,
June 14, 1800, and the treaty of Lunéville, February 9,
1801, had restored peace to the Continent; the French
troops would not now re-enforce an enemy to the allies of
Great Britain. Not only so, but since the power of Austria
had been broken, Great Britain herself was intending a
peace, to which the policy of Bonaparte at that time pointed.
It was therefore important to her that in the negotiations
the possession of Egypt, however barren, should not be one
of the cards in the adversary's hand. No terms were then
too easy, provided they insured the immediate departure of
the French army.</p>

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Atlantic, 1796-1801.—The Brest Blockades.—The French
Expeditions Against Ireland.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap">THE decision taken by the French executive in the latter
part of 1795,—after the disastrous partial encounters
of Martin with Hotham in the Mediterranean and
of Villaret Joyeuse with Bridport in the Bay of Biscay,—to
discontinue sending large fleets to sea, and to rely upon
commerce-destroying, by single cruisers or small squadrons,
to reduce the strength of Great Britain, remained
unchanged during the following years, and was adopted
by Bonaparte when the Consular government, in 1799,
succeeded that of the Directory. This policy was in strict
accord with the general feeling of the French nation, as
well naval officers as unprofessional men, by which the action
of the navy was ever subordinated to other military considerations,
to "ulterior objects," as the phrase commonly
ran,—a feeling that could not fail to find favor and expression
in the views of the great director of armies who ruled
France during the first fourteen years of this century. It
amounted, however, simply to abandoning all attempt to
control the sea. Consequently, whenever any enterprise
was undertaken which required this to be crossed, resort
was necessarily had to evasion, more or less skilfully contrived;
and success depended, not upon the reasonable certainty
conferred by command of the water, by the skilful
massing of forces, but upon a balance of chances, which
might be more or less favorable in the particular instance,
but could never be regarded as reaching the degree of security
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
which is essential, even in the hazardous combinations
of the game of war. This formal relegation of the
navy to a wholly inferior place in the contest then raging,
was followed, under the embarrassments of the treasury, by
a neglect of the material of war, of the ships and their
equipments, which left France still at Great Britain's
mercy, even when in 1797 and 1798 her Continental enemies
had been shaken off by the audacity and address of
Bonaparte.</p>

<p>Thrice only, therefore, during the six years in question,
ending with the Peace of Amiens in 1802, did large French
fleets put to sea; and on each occasion their success was
made to depend upon the absence of the British fleets, or
upon baffling their vigilance. As in commerce-destroying,
stealth and craft, not force, were the potent factors. Of
the three efforts, two, Bonaparte's Egyptian expedition and
Bruix's escape from Brest in 1799, have been already
narrated under the head of the Mediterranean, to which
they chiefly—-the former wholly—belong. The third was
the expedition against Ireland, under the command of
Hoche, to convoy which seventeen ships-of-the-line and
twenty smaller vessels sailed from Brest in the last days
of 1796.</p>

<p>The operations in the Atlantic during this period were
accordingly, with few exceptions, reduced to the destruction
of commerce, to the harassment of the enemy's communications
on the sea, and, on the part of the British, to
an observation, more or less vigilant, of the proceedings in
the enemy's naval ports, of which Brest was the most important.
From the maritime conditions of the two chief
belligerents, the character of their undertakings differed.
British commerce covered every sea and drew upon all
quarters of the world; consequently French cruisers could
go in many directions upon the well known commercial
routes, with good hope of taking prizes, if not themselves
captured. British cruisers, on the other hand, could find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
French merchant vessels only on their own coast, for the
foreign traffic of France in ships of her own was destroyed;
but the coasting trade, carried on in vessels generally of
from thirty to a hundred tons, was large, and in the maritime
provinces took in great measure the place of land carriage.
The neutrals who maintained such foreign trade as
was left to the enemies of Great Britain, and who were
often liable to detention from some infraction, conscious or
unconscious, of the rules of international law, were naturally
to be found in greatest numbers in the neighborhood
of the coasts to which they were bound. Finally, the larger
proportion of French privateers were small vessels, intended
to remain but a short time at sea and to cruise in the
Channel or among its approaches, where British shipping
most abounded. For all these reasons the British provided
for the safety of their distant commerce by concentrating
it in large bodies called convoys, each under the protection
of several ships of war; while their scattered cruisers were
distributed most thickly near home,—in the English Channel,
between the south coast of Ireland and Ushant, in the
waters of the bay of Biscay, and along the coasts of Spain
and Portugal. There they were constantly at hand to repress
commerce-destroying, to protect or recapture their
own merchantmen, and to reduce the coasting trade of the
enemy, as well as the ability of his merchants to carry on,
under a neutral flag, the operations no longer open to their
own. The annals of the time are consequently filled, not
with naval battles, but with notes of vessels taken and
retaken; of convoys, stealing along the coast of France,
chased, harassed and driven ashore, by the omnipresent
cruisers of the enemy. Nor was it commerce alone that
was thus injured. The supplying of the naval ports, even
with French products, chiefly depended upon the coasting
vessels; and embarrassment, amounting often to disability,
was constantly entailed by the unflagging industry of the
hostile ships, whose action resembled that which is told of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
the Spanish guerillas, upon the convoys and communications
of the French armies in the Peninsular War.
<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>The watch over the enemy's ports, and particularly over
the great and difficult port of Brest, was not, during the
earlier and longer part of this period, maintained with the
diligence nor with the force becoming a great military
undertaking, by which means alone such an effort can be
made effective in checking the combinations of an active
opponent. Some palliation for this slack service may perhaps
be found in the knowledge possessed by the admiralty
of the condition of the French fleet and of the purposes of
the French government, some also in the well-known opinions
of that once active officer, Lord Howe; but even these
circumstances can hardly be considered more than a palliation
for a system essentially bad. The difficulties were certainly
great, the service unusually arduous, and it was
doubtless true that the closest watch could not claim a perfect
immunity from evasion; but from what human efforts
can absolute certainty of results be predicted? and above
all, in war? The essential feature of the military problem,
by which Great Britain was confronted, was that the hostile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
fleets were divided, by the necessities of their administration,
among several ports. To use these scattered divisions
successfully against her mighty sea power, it was
needed to combine two or more of them in one large body.
To prevent such a combination was therefore the momentous
duty of the British fleet; and in no manner could this
be so thoroughly carried out as by a close and diligent
watch before the hostile arsenals,—not in the vain hope that
no squadron could ever, by any means, slip out, but with
the reasonable probability that at no one period could so
many escape as to form a combination threatening the Empire
with a crushing disaster. Of these arsenals Brest, by
its situation and development, was the most important, and
contained usually the largest and most efficient of the masses
into which the enemies' fleets were divided. The watch over
it, therefore, was of supreme consequence; and in the most
serious naval crisis of the Napoleonic wars the Brest "blockading"
fleet, as it was loosely but inaccurately styled, by the
firmness of its grip broke up completely one of the greatest
of Napoleon's combinations. To it, and to its admiral, Cornwallis,
was in large measure due that the vast schemes
which should have culminated in the invasion of England,
by one hundred and fifty thousand of the soldiers who
fought at Austerlitz and Jena, terminated instead in the
disaster of Trafalgar. Yet it may be said that had there
prevailed in 1805 the system with which the names of Howe
and Bridport are identified, and which was countenanced
by the Admiralty until the stern Earl St. Vincent took
command, the chances are the French Brest fleet would
have taken its place in the great strategic plan of the
Emperor.</p>

<p>This far-reaching combination, so tremendous in its
risks and in its issues that men have doubted, and always
will doubt, whether Napoleon seriously meant to carry it
through, was but the supreme example of the dangers to
which Great Britain was exposed, and from which her fleets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
had to shield her. It was aimed, with the true insight of
genius, directly at her heart; and except from occasional assertions
of the emperor, whose words can never be implicitly
believed, there is really little cause for doubt that he was
prepared to take many chances of ruin in order to execute
an enterprise which, both in conception and details, was
so clearly stamped with the characteristics of his intellect
and temperament. But the widely scattered dominions of
Great Britain offered many points, besides the British islands
themselves, to the blows of an enemy; and her navy
had to protect not merely the heart but the extremities,
each and all of which were threatened, in proportion to their
value and their means of resistance, when a hostile squadron
was loose upon the sea. How, then, should this service
be performed? By dividing the fleet among the
points threatened, and establishing the line of defence close
before the region to be defended? Not so should the true
maxim, that the British navy was the first line of defence,
have been interpreted. As in all military campaigns, the
front of operations of a powerful fleet should be pushed as
far towards the enemy as is consistent with the mutual
support of the various detachments, and with secure communication
with their base. By so doing, not only are
the great national interests placed more remote from the
alarms of war, but the use of the region behind the front
of operations, in this case the sea, is secured to the power
that can afford to maintain its fighting line close to the
enemy's positions.</p>

<p>Not merely to check great combinations threatening
great disasters, but to protect as far as possible minor but
important interests, and for the security of commerce itself,
the true station for the British fleets, superior in temper if
not in numbers to the enemy, was before the hostile ports
and as close to them as might be. There, though their function
was defensive, as in the last analysis that of the British
Empire also was, they were ever ready, did opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
offer, to assume the offensive. "Every opportunity will be
given to the Toulon squadron to put to sea," wrote Nelson,
"for it is on the sea that we hope to realize the expectations
of our country,"—a hope which it was given him to
fulfil at Trafalgar, where the greater designs of Napoleon
were forever crushed. This hope of Nelson's was, however,
based upon a close watch of his port, to establish which by
constant cruising before it he avowed his purpose;
<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and the
enforced abandonment of this plan, from the crazy condition
of several of his ships, was the first cause of the perplexities
which pursued him through the campaign. Did
an enemy's division escape, as from Toulon and at other
times, the general policy was not invalidated by such occasional
failure. The first line of defence had been pierced
at a single point; there still remained the other lines,
the fortified ports and the soldiers behind them, or, in a
maritime region like the West Indies, a detachment of
ships more or less adequate to contest the ground until
re-enforced.</p>

<p>A wisely co-ordinated system of defence does not contemplate
that every point is to hold out indefinitely, but only
for such time as may be necessary for it to receive the support
which the other parts of the whole are intended to
supply. That the navy is the first line of defence, both in
order and in importance, by no means implies that there is
or should be no other. This forced and extravagant interpretation,
for which naval officers have been largely responsible,
of the true opinion that a navy is the best protection
for a sea frontier, has very much to do with that faulty
strategy which would tie the fleet, whatever its power, to
the home ports, and disseminate it among them. Navies
do not dispense with fortifications nor with armies; but
when wisely handled, they may save their country the
strain which comes when these have to be called into play,—when
war, once remote, now thunders at the gates, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
the sea, the mother of prosperity, is shut off. This kindly
office did British seamen for Great Britain in the days of
Napoleon, and mainly through those close blockades of
which St. Vincent set the pattern before Toulon in the
Mediterranean,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
and afterwards before Brest, when he took
command of the Channel fleet.</p>

<p>The port of Brest, regarded as the principal hostile arsenal
round which must centre the operations of a great part
of the British navy, has to be considered under two sets of
conditions: 1st, as to its position, relatively to the British
bases of operations and to points of British territory open
to attack; 2d, as to its own immediate surroundings, how
far they facilitated the action of the French navy, and what
dispositions of the British fleet were necessary in order
best to impede that action. The former question is strategic
in its character, the latter tactical.</p>

</div>

<p>At the end of the peninsula which forms the north-western
extremity of France, there is a deep recess in
the land, between two capes which lie nearly in the same
north and south line, and are called Pointe St. Mathieu and
Pointe du Raz. The former is the more northerly, and the
distance separating the two is seventeen miles. A promontory
making out from the bottom of the recess divides it
into two bays of unequal dimensions, of which the southern
is known as the Bay of Douarnenez and the northern as
that of Brest. The entrance to the former is five miles
wide and unobstructed, so that only partial shelter is obtained;
it gives, however, a safe though rough anchorage,
even in westerly gales. The Bay of Brest, of smaller surface,
is entered by a passage three miles long and only one
wide, called the Goulet. With such an approach, and
further favored by the configuration of the surrounding
land, perfect security is found there, as well as facility for
carrying on the work of a fleet, when it would be impossible
at the more exposed anchorage of Douarnenez.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
From the Goulet to Pointe St. Mathieu the distance is seven
miles; and immediately outside the former are two open
roadsteads, Bertheaume to the north and Camaret to the
south, frequently occupied by French ships prior to a final
start on an expedition, or when waiting for a wind.</p>

<p>Had these features constituted the whole of the hydrographic
surroundings of Brest Harbor, the task of a British
admiral would have been simpler. A singular combination
of dangers conspired to force him, even in favorable
weather, to a station much further from the coast, and at
the same time tended to facilitate the exit of the French.
From both Pointe St. Mathieu and Pointe du Raz a strip of
foul ground, comparatively narrow, extends for fifteen miles
directly out to sea. That from St. Mathieu trends west-north-west
and terminates in the island of Ushant;
<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> while from
Pointe du Raz a succession of reefs, shoals, and low islands,
the whole known as the Chaussée de Sein, stretches nearly
due west to a point due south of Ushant and distant from it
twenty-two miles. Between these two long, low barriers
lay the principal approach to Brest, the Iroise Channel,—fifteen
miles long and of a width varying from seventeen
to twenty-two, nearly double that of the Straits of Gibraltar,—in
which it was not possible to maintain a body
of heavy vessels, particularly the three-decked ships, of
ninety guns and over, which formed a large fraction of the
Channel fleet and were singularly wanting in weatherly
qualities. Their short, high hulls and heavy top-hamper
caused them to drift rapidly in bad weather; and they
needed plenty of open sea to leeward for this reason, and
also that they might run before the wind, if too violent.
To try to keep these formidable but unhandy vessels in the
Iroise during the heavy westerly gales which prevail in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Bay of Biscay,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
with no refuge from the sea save the enemy's
port under their lee, was to court destruction.</p>

<p>To keep the English Channel open in case of very heavy
weather was therefore essential to the British fleet. The
Island of Ushant, as favoring this object and also as a conspicuous,
easily recognized off-shore position, became the
strategic centre around which the movements of the main
body of the fleet revolved, and to which all dispositions
made to ensure the watching of Brest must have regard, as
to their natural point of reference.</p>

<p>Given the superiority of force which the British navy
usually possessed, a superiority none too great to bear the
tremendous strain imposed by the dangerous weather and
coasts it had to encounter, the supreme strategic factor was
the wind. Brest is farther west than any English Channel
port except Falmouth, which is on the meridian of Ushant.
Falmouth, however, did not stand well as a port in the
general naval opinion of the day, though it had warm advocates;
<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
and it was undoubtedly wanting in room for a
number of heavy ships to anchor together. East of Falmouth
there were available the anchorages of Plymouth,
Torbay, and Spithead, distant from Ushant respectively 120,
135, and 210 miles, Falmouth being only 100; but with
the exception of Spithead, they were not secure in all winds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Plymouth Sound was exposed to the point of danger in
south-west gales. Torbay, though safe in westerly weather,
was at times dangerous, as well as difficult to leave, in the
south-easterly storms, which were, however, exceptional.</p>

<p>Spithead was secure, and was moreover the roadstead of
a great naval arsenal, as was also Plymouth Sound; but its
distance, a hundred miles east of Torbay, with the wind
prevailing three-fourths of the time from the westward,
should have been considered an insuperable strategic objection
to sailing ships destined to watch Brest, and especially
to fleets. A sailing ship of fair qualities, proceeding
against a dead head wind, makes good only one third of
the distance she actually sails. With such a wind a port
one hundred miles distant is actually three hundred, and
with fleets progress is even slower. To this was added at
Spithead a difficulty seemingly trivial, yet so insuperable
as to be humiliating. With a south-east wind, favorable
to go down Channel, three-decked ships could not get from
the anchorage to St. Helen's (the outer roads only three
miles distant), whence they could sail with a fair wind.</p>

<p>The whole theory of the blockade of Brest rested on the
fact that the French fleet could not sail in such westerly
weather as forced the British to take refuge in port,
<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and
upon the expectation that the latter by diligence could regain
their station with the first of the east wind, in time to
prevent the enemy's escape. This expectation depended
upon the greater rapidity of the British movements and
consequently upon the distance of the point of refuge. For
this reason Spithead was singularly unfit to be the rendezvous
of the fleet; yet it was chosen and maintained by both
Howe and Bridport during the seven years of their consecutive
commands. To this they added the practice of keeping
the main body of the fleet in port during the winter months.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
The Admiralty, doubtless, was ultimately responsible; but,
even with the sharp lessons of the Irish expedition and
Bruix's escape, it needed the advent of an admiral of St.
Vincent's sagacity and temper to insure the adoption of a
more rational and vigorous system. In his words to the
second in command,—when the wild winter weather and
his own declining years compelled him to withdraw from
the flag-ship,—"You are on <i>no</i> account to authorize any
ships to go to Spithead, unless you receive special orders
from the Admiralty or from me,"<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> is summed up the simple,
yet fundamental, difference between his policy and that of
his predecessors. All his other careful arrangements to
expedite the refitting of ships, and prolong their stay
on the station, are but detailed instances of the same effort
to save time, to keep his fleet concentrated at the decisive
point, and in the largest mass possible.</p>

<p>After Howe finally retired from the command, Bridport
established his headquarters at Spithead, where during the
winter and early spring the main body of the fleet was
commonly assembled. The commander-in-chief seems himself
to have lived ashore, being in April, 1796, created general
port-admiral with liberal appointments. Squadrons of
seven or eight ships-of-the-line, about a fourth of the total
force, cruised to the westward of Ushant, "in the soundings,"
during the winter, for periods of two or three
months, returning to Spithead when relieved. Thus was
practically realized Lord Howe's policy, to economize the
ships and depend upon vessels kept in good order by staying
in port to follow the French, when information of their
sailing was received. This also was the general plan at
the time of the French expedition against Ireland in the
winter of 1796-1797.</p>

<p>The widespread discontent in Ireland, especially in the
Protestant North, was well known to the Directory, with
which, through the French minister at Hamburg, Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
agents had been in communication as early as April, 1796.
Another, the somewhat celebrated Wolfe Tone, had in the
first months of the year arrived in Paris from the United
States with a similar mission. To their efforts was added
the powerful influence of General Hoche, who had in
other fields of action shown military ability of the highest
order; and who, having established his claims upon the
gratitude of his country by the pacification of La Vendée
and Brittany, was now in command of the army in that
quarter. In all directions circumstances seemed favorable.
Bonaparte was in the midst of his great Italian successes;
and the reverses inflicted upon Jourdan and Moreau in
Germany by the Archduke Charles were neutralized, for
the winter at least, by the necessity of drawing upon his
troops to renew the Austrian armies in Italy. Spain had
declared war against Great Britain; and there were hopes,
destined to be frustrated by the lethargy of her movements
and by the battle of Cape St. Vincent, that the Spanish fleet
could be made to combine with the French for the purposed
invasion. The mission of Lord Malmesbury, although
the British government held its head high, seemed
to indicate failing confidence; and the British navy, however
successful in seizing the colonial possessions of its
enemies in all parts of the world, had been unable, through
the retirement of the French fleets from the sea, to win
any of those brilliant victories which restore the courage
of nations. St. Vincent, Camperdown, and the Nile were
still in the future.</p>

<p>The proposed invasion was consequently resolved. It
depended avowedly upon the co-operation of the disaffected
inhabitants; but Hoche did not make the mistake of trusting
to them for the most serious part of the work. No
less than twenty thousand troops were to be embarked;
and as the general recognized that the difficulties would by
no means be over when Ireland was reached,—that the
British navy, if successfully eluded by the expedition, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
nevertheless seriously interfere with subsequent supplies,—he
insisted upon carrying with him as much of these, and
consequently as many ships, as could be had in Brest.
Efforts were made to increase the force in that port. Five
ships under Admiral Villeneuve were ordered round from
Toulon;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
Richery's squadron was expected from North
America,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
and the Spaniards were also called upon. These
efforts, however, only caused delay, and contributed but two
of Richery's ships to swell the expedition, the others being
found too shaken to be sent at once to sea. Villeneuve did
not arrive in time, and the Spaniards remained in the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The number of seamen at the disposal of the government
was limited, owing to many causes; among which the
principal were discontent with the navy, and the superior
attractions of privateering, which had led not merely to
their choosing that service, but also to many being captured
at sea and so lost to their country. This deficiency
imposed a proportionate limit to the number of ships that
could be fitted. There was a dearth likewise of good watch
officers. Besides these controlling circumstances, there were
also some manifest advantages in reducing to the smallest
numbers the vessels composing an expedition, which was
to avoid action, to make a short passage at the stormiest
season of the year, and which it was all important should
keep united and arrive together. For these reasons it was
decided that the troops should be embarked on the ships-of-war
to their fullest capacity. Each ship-of-the-line carried
six hundred soldiers, making with her crew a ship's company
of thirteen hundred souls. The frigates received
about two hundred and fifty each. Although in this particular
instance the arguments in favor of transporting the
army in the ships-of-war outweighed those against, there is
always a grave disadvantage to the handling and fighting
of vessels encumbered by so many useless and generally
sea-sick men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>Never, however, was a great expedition, destined to encounter
extraordinary risks and to brave one of the stormiest
of seas, more favored than this at the first was by the
elements and by the mismanagement of its enemies. For
nearly six weeks before it sailed the winds prevailed from
the east; and during the passage, in mid-winter, fine weather
with favorable winds lasted until the bulk of the fleet
reached the Irish coast. Nor was an enemy's vessel met,
to take advantage of the crowded and inefficient condition
of the French ships. Like Bonaparte's expedition to
Egypt, though from other causes, Hoche's ships passed to
their destination unseen by any foe powerful enough to molest.
To the enfeebled state of the French navy, to the
decay of its material, to the want of seamen, to the disappearance
of the trained officers, and to the consequent disinclination
of the superiors to undertake the expedition, is
to be attributed the failure of an attempt in which their
sympathies had never been enlisted. Hoche, who had supreme
command of both army and navy,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> found by bitter
experience the delays which incompetent or ill-affected
subordinates can impose, especially in a branch of service
of which the commander-in-chief has not particular knowledge.
Villaret Joyeuse, first appointed to command the
fleet, being keenly aware of its defects, was averse from an
enterprise which, in all reasonable probability, would lead
to a meeting at once with the British and with excessively
bad weather. He wished, as did also Truguet, the Minister
of Marine, to take a heavy squadron of eight ships to India;
whereby, if the first encounter with the enemy were evaded,
a long passage with much good weather would permit the
crews to be trained, while in the Indian seas they would
be superior in force to their opponents. Truguet, however,
harmonized this object with the proposed expedition by
purposing to send the ships to India after their return from
Ireland; while Villaret, who had spent in the ports the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
years which the minister had passed in Paris, and knew
intimately the deplorable state of both men and ships, had
little hope of the latter coming back in any state to undertake
his favorite project.</p>

<p>The hardly concealed bias of the admiral, and the apathy
of the naval officers generally, inspired Hoche with doubts
of Villaret's faithfulness to his task; and upon his urgent
remonstrance Morard de Galles, who fifteen years before
had been like Villaret among the bravest captains of the
great Suffren, succeeded to the command. The new admiral
brought to his duty the submissive devotion of a military
man, and had not, as Villaret had, any counter-project of his
own; but the radical defects of an organization, vitiated by
years of neglect and false standards, could not be overcome
by a man already advanced in years in the few short days
of hurried preparation. Such as the French navy had become,
through the loss of its heads and the vagaries of the
legislature, such it sailed on the expedition to Ireland.
"God keep me from having anything to do with the navy!"
wrote Hoche. "What an extravagant compound! A great
body whose parts are disunited and incoherent; contradictions
of all kinds, indiscipline organized in a military body.
Add to that, haughty ignorance and foolish vanity, and you
have the picture filled out. Poor Morard de Galles! he has
already aged twenty years; how I pity him!"
<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>The administrative difficulties, caused by poverty of resources,
conspired with the non-arrival of Richery and
Villeneuve to delay the expedition. Fixed first for the
early autumn and then for the first of November, it was not
able to sail till the middle of December. Richery had
reached the anchorage of Île d'Aix
<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> on the 5th of November
with five ships-of-the-line; but not till the 8th of the
following month could his vessels, racked by their long
cruise, sail for Brest. On the 11th they entered the port,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
where upon examination two only of them were found fit
for the Irish voyage; and the wait for these entailed a delay
which had a singular effect upon the fortunes of the
undertaking.</p>

<p>On the 15th of December the whole body of ships, except
Richery's two, got under way, stood through the Goulet, and
anchored that evening in Bertheaume and Camaret roads,
ready for a start,—the wind still fair as fair could be, at
east. The British, under the lax and cautious system pursued
by Bridport and his lieutenants, had then no ships-of-the-line
close up to the port, but only two or three frigates,
and these Morard de Galles drove off with a small detached
squadron, hoping thus to deprive the enemy of precise
knowledge of his movements. Sir Edward Pellew, the
senior officer of the frigates, sent one of them, the "Phœbe,"
to Admiral Colpoys, commanding the division of Bridport's
fleet then cruising; which, in consequence of the preparations
known to be going on in Brest, had been increased
to fifteen sail-of-the-line, double the usual winter squadron.
Contrary to Lord St. Vincent's sound maxim, "Well up
with Ushant in an easterly wind," Colpoys's rendezvous was
about eight leagues to the west of the island, and thither
the frigate went to seek him; but his force, composed
largely of three-deckers, having let go the shelter of the
land, had been driven farther still to leeward, and being
nearly fifty miles from Ushant was not found by the
"Phœbe" till the 19th, three days after the French finally
sailed.</p>

<p>Pellew, one of the most active frigate captains of the
time, retired but a short distance from his pursuers, and
next day, the 16th, again stood in for the French anchorage
with his own ship,—well named the "Indefatigable,"—and
the "Révolutionnaire." At noon the enemy
were again sighted, and not long after, Pellew's vigilance
was rewarded by seeing them get under way. Richery's two
ships, "Pégase" and "Révolution," came through the Goulet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
towards noon, and all the expedition began at once to lift
their anchors between two and three <span class="sc">P. M.</span> of the short
winter day. Dispatching the "Révolutionnaire" to the admiral,
Pellew himself remained to watch the course taken
by the enemy.</p>

<p>The imperative need of the French being to escape
meeting the British, and to reach Ireland with force undiminished
either by capture or straggling, Morard de Galles'
first object was to avoid Colpoys's fleet. This was known
to be in the direction of Ushant, having been seen on more
than one occasion from the island, and by Richery when entering
Brest. If the departure were unperceived, the uncertainty
of the enemy as to the destination might be counted
on to favor the further movements of the expedition. The
French admiral therefore determined to use the advantage,
inestimable to a naval port, which Brest possesses in a
double entrance. Between the Pointe du Raz and the
Chaussée de Sein<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
there is a channel known as the Passage
du Raz. It is narrow, being less than three miles wide in
one part, and is sown with dangers, formidable above all
in the night season, during which it must be passed if the
enemy were to be kept in ignorance; but with a fair wind
and good pilots the thing could be done. Morard de Galles
therefore gave the order to the fleet to head, upon getting
under way, for the Passage du Raz, and informed the captains
that, after clearing it, he intended to steer west for one
hundred miles. Having provided for keeping the fleet together
so far, each commanding officer was also given a
sealed packet, directing him what to do in case of separation.
It may be said here that these packets,—which
were not to be opened unless in case of parting company,—directed
to make Cape Mizen Head on the south coast of
Ireland, near the entrance of Bantry Bay, the anchorage
whence the landing was to be made. There the separated
vessels were to cruise five days, waiting for orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>At three o'clock the whole fleet was under sail, the sun
was sinking fast, the weather gloomy and squally; and the
vessels, unable to form from the inexperience of their
officers, were running disorderly for the dangerous pass,
the entrance to which, being fifteen miles from the anchorage
they were leaving, could not be reached before dark.
The flag-officers, except Richery, had quitted their own
ships-of-the-line and gone aboard frigates, the two commanders,
Hoche and Morard de Galles, being together on
board the "Fraternité." As night fell, the wind hauled to
the southward, threatening to become foul, under which
conditions the passage of the Raz would be impossible.
Moved by the danger, and considering that Colpoys was
not within sight, the admiral by signal countermanded his
order, and directed the fleet to put before the wind and run
out by the Iroise channel. In the confusion and growing
darkness this order was not understood. Morard's own
ship and half a dozen more, one only of which was of the
line, obeyed; but all the others continued for the Passage
du Raz. Thus, at the very moment of starting, the two
principal officers were separated from their command. In
vain did Morard send a corvette to enforce his order by
voice or by signal,—she was not understood; and the
confusion was increased by Pellew, who, attaching himself
to the leading ships, kept on with them through the Iroise,
and by burning rockets and blue lights, and firing guns,
rendered utterly incoherent the attempts of the French
admiral to convey by similar means his meaning to his
fleet.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
In the midst of the turmoil the "Séduisant," of
seventy-four guns, ran on a rock which lies across the entrance
to the passage, and was totally wrecked, her guns
and signals of distress adding to the uproar.
<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> At half-past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
eight, the "Indefatigable" saw the ships with which she
had kept company pass round the outer end of the Chaussée
de Sein and steer to the southward, with the hope,
doubtless, of rejoining their consorts. Pellew then made
sail for Falmouth, where he arrived on the 20th of December.
Had this port then been the rendezvous of the Channel
fleet, or even of a strong detachment, there would still
have been time, for the French did not reach Bantry Bay
till the 22d; the wind was east, and the distance but two
hundred and fifty miles.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th of December, the French
were divided into three bodies out of sight of each other.
With the two commanders-in-chief were one ship-of-the-line
and three frigates. Rear-Admiral Bouvet, the second
in command, had with him eight ships-of-the-line and nine
other vessels. In accordance with his orders he continued
to steer west during the 17th and 18th. On the 19th, having
opened his sealed instructions and reached the longitude
of Mizen Head, he changed the course to north, and
the same day was joined by the third section of the expedition,
thus concentrating under his command fifteen
ships-of-the-line, and, with three unimportant exceptions,
all the other vessels except those with Hoche and Morard.
Grouchy, second to Hoche, was with Bouvet; so that the
admiral now had with him practically the whole body of
the expedition. Unfortunately the soul, the young, gallant,
and skilful Hoche, the emulous rival of Bonaparte's growing
glory, who saw in the Irish expedition the great hope
of restoring the brilliancy of his own star, paling before
that of his competitor,—Hoche was absent.</p>

<p>With a brief exception of southwesterly weather, the
wind continued from the eastward during the whole of
Bouvet's passage; and notwithstanding a good deal of
fog, at times very dense,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> all those who were with him on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the 19th—thirty-five out of the forty-three which composed
the expedition—found themselves on the early morning of
December 21st together, and in full sight of the Irish coast.
"It is most delicious weather," wrote the eager, restless
Irishman, Wolfe Tone, who was on board one of the ships,
"with a favorable wind and everything we can desire, except
our missing comrades. At the moment I am writing
we are under easy sail, within three leagues at most of
the coast, so that I can discern patches of snow upon the
mountains. What if the general do not join? If we cruise
here five days according to our instructions, the English
will be upon us and all will be over. <i>Nine o'clock</i> (<span class="sc">P. M.</span>).
We are now at the rendezvous appointed; stood in for the
coast till twelve (noon), when we were near enough to toss
a biscuit ashore. At twelve tacked and stood out again, so
we have now begun our cruise of five days in all its forms.... We
opened Bantry Bay; and in all my life rage
never entered so deep into my heart as when we turned
our backs. Continue making short tacks; the wind foul."
<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>The wind was now foul, not because of its own change,
but because from the entrance of Bantry Bay to its head
the direction is east-north-east. The wind that had been
favorable for leaving Brest and for the passage was for
the short remaining distance, not over thirty miles at the
most, nearly dead ahead. Unfortunately, also, in sailing
north along the meridian of Bantry Bay, the east wind
had set the fleet imperceptibly to the westward, so that
the land first seen was not Mizen Head, at the eastern
side of the entrance, but Dursey Island, at the western.
<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
Had the intended landfall been made, the ships might, by
hauling close round Mizen Head, have fetched a point at
least twelve miles inside of Dursey Island and there anchored.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Now that fortune ceased to waft them with favoring
gales, the weaknesses of the expedition became painfully
apparent. Crews composed mainly of landsmen, with a
very small sprinkling of able seamen, crowded and impeded
at every turn by the swarming mass of soldiery, were ill
able to do the rapid handling of ropes and canvas necessitated
by a dead beat of thirty miles, against a strong
head wind in a narrow bay, where every rod lost tells, and
requires three or four rods of sailing to be regained; where
sails must be reefed or hoisted, set or furled, at a moment's
notice, and the canvas spread varies from half-hour to
half-hour. Such a tug tasks the skill, as it proclaims the
excellence, of the smartest single ship, though she find the
channel clear of other vessels; but to a fleet of thirty-five,
manned and equipped as those of Bouvet, and compelled to
give way continually as they crossed each other's paths, it
proved impossible to reach the head of Bantry Bay, where
shelter would have been found from the east winds, which
for the following week blew with relentless fury.</p>

<p>Through the night of the 21st and all day of the 22d, the
fleet continued turning to windward; and toward nightfall
the admiral anchored with eight of-the-line and seven other
vessels off Bear Island, still twelve miles from the head of
the bay. The other twenty ships remained outside under
way. All the 23d it blew hard from the eastward, and
nothing was done. On the 24th the weather moderated,
and it was decided to attempt a landing, although no more
ships had come in,—the twenty outside having been blown
to sea. Those at the anchorage got under way, but made
no progress. "I believe," wrote the exasperated Wolfe
Tone, "that we have made three hundred tacks, and have
not gained a hundred yards in a straight line." At sunset
the division again anchored; and during the night the wind
rose to a gale, which continued all the 25th and prevented
any boat work. Several ships dragged, and some cables
parted. Soon after nightfall the cable of Bouvet's flag-ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
gave way, and the "Immortalité" began to drive upon Bear
Island. A second anchor failing to hold her, the admiral
cut both cables and put to sea, signalling the other vessels
to do likewise and hailing to the same effect those near
whom he passed, among others the ship on board which
Wolfe Tone was. This, however, held on—her captain
becoming the senior naval officer present—till the 27th.
The wind then falling, a council of war was held, and decided
that as there were but four thousand soldiers in the
bay, and as neither cannon, ammunition nor provisions
necessary for the landing remained at the anchorage, the
attempt must be abandoned. The wind now changing to
south-west and threatening a storm, this little division,
reduced to six ships-of-the-line and four smaller vessels,
sailed for Brest, where they arrived on the 12th of January.
Rear-Admiral Bouvet had long preceded them, having
reached Brest on the 1st of the month.
<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> By the 14th, four
weeks and a day after sailing from Brest, thirty-five of the
expedition had returned safe, though greatly battered, to
French ports, after various adventures not necessary to
relate. Five, including the "Séduisant," wrecked on the
night of sailing, had been lost or destroyed by their officers,
and six captured<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> by the British.</p>

<p>The one still to be accounted for closed dramatically the
adventure, which, having begun by the wreck of one
ship-of-the-line, ended with the yet more deplorable destruction
of another. This, called by the good revolutionary
name "Droits de l'Homme," had clung tenaciously to the
Irish coast till January 5th; but, finding herself alone and
no hope remaining, started then to return to Brest. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
13th she fell in with two British frigates, one the "Indefatigable,"
Pellew's ship. The two closed with her, and
just before nightfall the French vessel carried away her
fore and main topmasts. The wind was blowing hard from
the westward, and her captain, fearing momentarily to meet
enemy's ships of greater force and numbers, decided to run
steadily for his own coast. At half-past five the "Indefatigable,"
whose sail power was untouched, drew up, and
the battle began. An hour later her consort, the "Amazon,"
came within range. Through the long night, with a few
intermissions at the choice of the uncrippled British frigates,
the strife went on,—the embarrassed condition of the
"Droits de l'Homme" being increased by the fall of her
mizzen mast at half-past ten. The sea was running so high
that the crews of the frigates fought up to their middles in
water, while the ship-of-the-line could not use her lower
tier of guns; and at the end the "Indefatigable," the sole
survivor of the conflict, had four feet of water in her hold.
At half-past four on the morning of the 14th, land, for
which a lookout had been anxiously kept, was suddenly
seen. The two British ships were then holding positions a
little ahead, and on either bow, of the "Droits de l'Homme."
Each hauled to the wind on its own side of the enemy; the
"Indefatigable" to the south, the "Amazon" to the north.
All three were embayed in Audierne Bay, an unsheltered
beach thirty-five miles south of Brest, between Pointe du
Raz and the Penmarck rocks. By strenuous efforts the "Indefatigable,"
after wearing twice, cleared the latter by three
quarters of a mile. As she passed them in broad daylight,
the "Droits de l'Homme" lay on her side at the bottom of
the bay, the surf beating over her. The "Amazon," whose
situation had allowed too little time for skill to play, was
also aground two miles to the northward. Here, however,
the resemblance ceased. The trained and disciplined British
crew got safe to land. The unfortunate French ship,
crowded to repletion with men for the most part wholly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
unaccustomed to the sea, had had the further misfortune
to take the bottom on a bank at a great distance from the
beach. Three days of awful exposure, without food or
water, followed. Not till the 17th did the subsidence of
the gale allow relief from shore, and only on the 18th did
the last survivor quit the wreck. Out of thirteen hundred
men on board her when the battle began, two hundred and
sixty were killed and wounded, and two hundred and seventeen
lost their lives through the wreck.</p>

<p>The singular circumstance that, despite the first separation
of the fleet on the night of sailing, the disconnected
units were yet for the most part brought together and
together reached the coast of Ireland, and yet that from
this happy meeting the most important vessel of all, carrying
the two commanders-in-chief, was excepted, creates a
legitimate curiosity as to the movements of the "Fraternité"
during these critical days. On the 17th, this ship had
with her two frigates and one ship-of-the-line,—the "Nestor."
On the 20th the other frigates had disappeared, the
"Nestor" alone remaining; but it was found, from subsequent
examination of the logs, that had the fog which then
covered the ocean lifted, the "Fraternité" would have
been in sight of the main body, which then, under Bouvet,
was steering north to make Mizen Head. That night the
"Nestor" parted company. On the 24th of December the
"Fraternité" was pursuing her course for Bantry Bay,
where the main body had already arrived, when a ship resembling
a ship-of-the-line was seen. As the stranger did
not reply to the signals made, the "Fraternité" took flight
to the westward, and, finding herself outsailed, threw overboard
some of her guns. During the night the pursuer was
thrown off, and the frigate again shaped her course for
Bantry Bay; but the same easterly gale which drove Bouvet
from the anchorage was now blowing in her teeth. On the
29th Hoche and Morard fell in with the first of the expedition
they had seen since the "Nestor" left them, and a sad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
meeting it was. One, the "Scevola," was sinking; the
other, the "Révolution," which had been badly injured by
a collision in Bantry Bay, was saving the "Scevola's"
crew. In the dangerous condition of the "Révolution,"
now having twenty-two hundred souls on board, with provisions
for but eight days, and having learned the dispersal
of the vessels in Bantry Bay, Hoche and Morard determined
to return. The two ships reached Rochefort on the 13th of
January. Whether Hoche, with his military ardor, the
high prestige of his fame, and the intense personal interest
felt by him in the success of the expedition, could have
triumphed over the material obstacles which defeated the
lukewarm energies of Bouvet, may be questioned; but it
was certainly an extraordinary circumstance that, of the
whole large body of ships, the one containing the two commanders
was almost alone in her failure to reach the Irish
coast.</p>

<p>From the preceding account, it is evident that the success
or failure of the French landing depended entirely
upon their ability to make the thirty miles intervening between
the entrance and the head of Bantry Bay. Whatever
may be thought of their prospects of ultimate success
in the conquest or deliverance of Ireland,—a matter of
pure speculation, dependent upon many conditions rather
political and economical than military,—it cannot be
questioned that they had succeeded in crossing the sea
and reaching almost their point of destination, not only despite
the British navy but without even seeing it. On
December 21st the bulk of the expedition was at the mouth
of Bantry Bay. Not till the 22d did Colpoys, commanding
the fleet watching, or rather detailed to watch, off Brest,
know they had actually sailed; and then he did not know
in what direction. Bridport at Portsmouth received the
news on the same, or possibly on the previous day, through
Pellew's diligence and forethought. Not till the 31st of
December was it known in London that the enemy had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
actually appeared off the Irish coast, and at that time Bridport's
fleet had not even sailed. Only continued bad
weather, and that ahead, prevented the landing which even
Bouvet would not have hesitated to make under better conditions.
Had no other harm resulted, the capture of Cork,
only forty-five miles distant, was certain. "We propose to
make a race for Cork as though the devil were in us," wrote
Wolfe Tone in his journal; and how severe the blow would
have been may be imagined, for in that place were collected
stores and supplies to the value of a million and a half
sterling, including the provisions for feeding the navy during
the next year. Ireland was then the great source from
which naval provisions were drawn.</p>

<p>Such a failure on the part of the British navy, with its
largely superior forces, can scarcely be called less than ignominious,
and invites now, as it did then, an examination
into the causes. The outcry raised at the time by panic
and disappointment has long ceased; but the incident affords
a fruitful field for study, as to how far the disposition
of the Channel fleet conformed to a reasonable
interpretation of the principles of war, as applied to the
sea.</p>

<p>It must be obvious to any one stopping to think, that, for
a fleet charged with thwarting the combinations of an
enemy's navy, there can be no point so well adapted as one
immediately before the port from which the greatest fraction
must sail. Once away, to an unknown destination, the
position to be taken becomes a matter of surmise, of guess,
which may be dignified by the name of sagacity if the guess
prove right, but which should not be allowed to cover the
original fault of disposition, if it could have been avoided.
To multiply instances would be tedious; but reference may
be made to two detailed elsewhere in this work, viz: Bridport,
upon the escape of Bruix in 1799,
<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and Nelson after
the escape of Villeneuve in 1805,
<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> though in the latter case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
the admiral's reasons for not cruising before Toulon were
not only adequate, but imperative.</p>

<p>A similar perplexity existed in the closing months of
1796. The government and the admiral of the Channel
fleet knew that a large expedition was preparing in Brest,
and they had reason to fear the co-operation with it of the
Spaniards. Opinion was somewhat divided as to the objective;
according to reports industriously circulated by the
French government, it might be Portugal the ally, Gibraltar
the outpost, or Ireland the dependency, of Great Britain.
One thing only was certain, that the surest and largest
component of the undertaking was in Brest. There soldiers
were gathering, and there also arms were being shipped
largely in excess of the troops,
<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> pointing to a hope of co-operation
by inhabitants at the point of landing. Such
conditions dictated certainly three things: 1, a force before
Brest superior to that of the enemy inside; 2, inasmuch
as the heavier ships must keep the channel open, against
the danger of violent westerly gales, there should be an advance
squadron of handier vessels close in with the port,
powerful enough to hold its ground if the enemy came out
and to keep touch with him if he sailed; 3, since Ireland
was by far the most important of the interests threatened,
the government should have indicated it to the admiral as
the point to be covered, in case he did lose knowledge of
the hostile fleet. The first of these provisions sums up the
main strategic requirement, to effect which all other strategic
dispositions should conduce. The second is tactical
in character, relating to the disposition of the force upon
the ground to which strategic considerations assign it. The
third presents the alternative, the second line of defence,
upon which, in case the first is forced, the defending fleet
falls back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>Colpoys's fleet of fifteen sail was certainly not superior
to the French. It might be considered adequate to frustrate
the expedition, if met, but not sufficient to inflict the
crushing blow that the policy and needs of Great Britain
imperatively demanded. Moreover, a military body is not
an inanimate object, like a rock, which once placed abides
unchanged for years. It is rather a living organism, depending
on daily nourishment, subject to constant waste, and needing
constant renewal. If to station a competent force before
Brest met the chief strategic requirement, its maintenance
there embraced a number of subordinate strategic provisions,
which in terms of land warfare are called communications.
Ships meet with accidents; they degenerate by wear and tear;
they consume water and provisions, their crews diminish by
illness and need rest by occasional returns to port. These
communications were not threatened by the French; but
they were open to injury by insufficient forethought and by
excessive distance, and from both they suffered. A division
like Colpoys's may be renewed in two ways. Either it may
be relieved by a body of similar number and go home; or it
may be continually receiving fresh ships and continually
sending old ones to the rear for rest. It need scarcely be
said that the latter is by far the better, preserving a continuity
of life and administration which the former breaks.
Not only so; but the other system presupposes a squadron
in port equal to that cruising, a reserve equal to the body
in the field,—a fantastic proportion, which sacrifices every
principle of warfare, and divides the available force into two
masses, which do not even pretend to support but merely
to replace each other.</p>

<p>A fleet charged with duty like that before Brest needs to
be fixed at the highest number the resources of the nation
can supply and supported by a reserve so proportioned that,
by a constant coming and going, no ship at the front should
ever be suffering from an exhaustion, either of condition or
of supplies, against which diligent human forethought could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
have provided. The station of this reserve is obviously a
matter of the utmost importance. It should, of course, be
as near as possible to the main body, and, for sailing ships,
favorably situated with reference to prevailing winds; for
a head wind meant not merely the loss of time caused by
itself, but often the loss of an opportunity which passes
with the time. Thus, on this very occasion, when the wind
blew fresh from the eastward, fair to go from Portsmouth
to Ireland, Bridport's ships were unable to use it, because
they could not make the stretch of three miles from Spithead
to St. Helen's. Nor is the nearness of a dockyard
a controlling condition for the reserve, though it may be
admitted that dockyards should be placed with reference
to probable theatres of war. On the contrary, a
yard is the last place to which to send an active ship.
Naval officers knew then, as they know now, that vessels
at dockyards become valetudinarians, whose doctors,
like some others, flatter the ailments of their patients
to increase their practice. An available reserve is one
thing, a ship needing dockyard repairs quite another;
and no countenance should be given to any confusion
of the two by keeping the reserve at, or close by, a
yard. Properly, the reserve should be simply that
portion of the active force which, for the benefit of the
whole, is for a moment resting, but is ready at once to
proceed.</p>

<p>How very little the government of the day and the then
admiral of the Channel fleet realized these principles, is
evident by a few facts. The reserve was at Spithead, a
roadstead over two hundred miles distant. It was equal in
force to the division before Brest. "The government
thought it the wisest plan," said its authorized defender in
the Commons, "to separate the fleet into different divisions.
One fleet was off Brest to watch the enemy and intercept
the sailing of the expedition; and another at home
to relieve the fleet off Brest, if necessary, or to pursue the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
enemy, if he should sail."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> When the French had escaped,
Colpoys received the news December 22d. His orders did
not cover the contingency, and in his uncertainty he first
decided to keep his station,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> than which nothing could be
more satisfactory to the French, who had made a long circuit
to avoid that particular spot. Like all men in the dark,
however, the admiral soon changed his mind and concluded
to go off the Lizard, a cape near Falmouth, where he might
receive information.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
Here, in the entrance to the Channel,
he found several ships in want of necessaries, and the
weather such that he could not provide them from others.
<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
This statement was disputed by the Admiralty, which,
however, admitted that some of these ships had not water
in abundance.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
With a properly worked reserve, a few
ships might have been short,—those, that is, whose turn
was to go in next,—but it is evident that a very disproportionate
number were here affected; for the explanation of
these short ships being still out was, that Curtis's squadron
of <i>seven</i> ships was to have relieved them, but had been delayed
for certain causes.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
Whatever the reason, the important
conclusion was that Colpoys, a good officer under a bad
system, put his helm up and ran into Spithead, where he
arrived December 31st, more than a week after the French
reached Bantry Bay.</p>

<p>While the subordinate was thus badgered by the inadequate
measures of his government and his chief, the latter
was leisurely preparing to relieve him off Brest. On the
21st or 22d, he was spurred up by news of the French sailing,
and replied that in <i>four</i> days he would be ready,—a
truly handy reserve with the British Islands about to be
invaded. On the 25th he got under way, and demonstrated
at once the fitness of Spithead as a station for the reserve.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
Eight ships only succeeded in getting to St. Helen's that
day, a sudden change of wind to south-east supervening;
"which, although favorable for his getting to sea, was directly
on the bows of the ships coming to join him from
Spithead."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
It was not thought prudent to sail with only
eight ships, and through the delay of waiting for the
others Bridport did not get away from St. Helen's (Portsmouth)
until January 3, 1797,—the day before the last of
the French abandoned Bantry Bay,—when he sailed with
fourteen of-the-line, a mass equal to Colpoys's division
which had just returned. An inadequate force at the decisive
point, inadequately maintained, and dependent upon
a reserve as large as itself, but unready and improperly
stationed,—such were the glaring faults of the strategic
disposition.</p>

<p>The tactical mistakes are equally apparent. The main
fleet was stationed so far at sea as to derive no shelter
from easterly storms. It contained several three-decked
ships,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
whose poor sailing qualities exaggerated to the last
degree the drift consequent upon bad weather. As a result,
at the critical moment, Colpoys, instead of being, according
to St. Vincent's maxim, "close in with Ushant in
an easterly wind," was over forty miles west of it, "working
up against a fresh east-south-east wind,"
<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and the next
day was driven to the northward by southerly weather.
Under such conditions any lookouts in the "Iroise" were
almost a vain show. It is of the essence of such a lookout,
however, that it should not be driven from its post by
a detachment so small that the enemy does not weaken
himself by making it. Of what consequence in this way
were three or four frigates, which the French could and
should have driven off by a half dozen, backed by two sail-of-the-line?
Properly to watch Brest required a strong detachment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
of line-of-battle-ships of the medium class, which
were handy and weatherly, and whose grip could only be
loosened by fighting. The correlative, however, of such a
big detachment is the main body close up, ready to support
it. The whole theory hangs together. The advanced detachment
close up, else it cannot watch; big enough, else
it cannot stay; the main body also close up, else the
advance guard is hazarded.</p>

<p>Under all these circumstances it is not strange that the
careful British chronicler, James, has to record that "during
the three or four weeks the French ships were traversing
in every direction the Irish and English Channels,
neither of the two British fleets (Bridport's nor Colpoys's),
appointed to look after them, succeeded in capturing a single
ship;" and "the principal losses by capture sustained
by the enemy arose from the diligence and activity of a
sixty-four-gun ship and four or five frigates, which, on the
29th of December, were lying in the harbor of Cork."
<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
Yet, after satisfying himself that the French had gone
back to Brest, Bridport returned to Spithead, and the old
system was resumed. In Parliament the ministry strongly
maintained that they had done all that could be expected;
and the First Lord went so far as to say that even an
inquiry would be considered an unmerited censure.
<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>It is no more than just to note, in this slack and shiftless
conduct of the war, the same sluggish spirit that, after
making all allowances for the undeniable grievances of the
seamen, was also responsible for the demoralization of discipline
in the Channel fleet, which soon after showed itself
openly,—among the crews in the mutinies of 1797, and
among the officers, at a later day, in the flagrant insubordination
with which St. Vincent's appointment was greeted.
Both show a lax hand in the chief naval commander; for,
while a government is responsible for its choice of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
latter, it must, especially in so technical a profession as
the navy then was, depend upon him for the enforcement
of discipline and for the choice of measures, at once practicable
and adequate, to compass the ends of the war.
Upon him, more than upon any other, must fall the responsibility
of failure; for he knows, or should know, better
than the government, what the fleet can be made to do,
what the state of discipline really is, and what his own capacity
to carry out the one and support the other. Only
through him can the government act. When it disregards
or overrides, without displacing him, mischief ensues; but
the correlative of the generous confidence and hearty support
it owes to him is, on his part, unceasing intense effort,
or resignation.</p>

<p>It is a relief, and instructive, to turn to the methods of
Earl St. Vincent. Having returned from the Mediterranean
in August, 1799, he was chosen to succeed Bridport upon
the latter's resignation in the following April. It is told
that, when his appointment became known, one of the
naval captains, at the table of the former commander-in-chief,
gave the toast, "May the discipline of the Mediterranean
never be introduced into the Channel fleet." If, as
is said, the admiral (presumably Lord Bridport) suffered
this to pass unrebuked, no words could depict more forcibly
than the simple incident the depths to which his own dignity
and control had sunk.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> It is, perhaps, needless to say
that St. Vincent met this temper with the same unbending
firmness that he had shown in his former command.</p>

<p>It is not, however, in his discipline, but in his management
of the Brest blockade, and the Channel fleet for the
support of that blockade, that we are here interested. The
force before Brest was largely increased, consisting at this
time of never less than twenty-four sail-of-the-line, and, until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
ordered by the Admiralty to be reduced, was maintained
by St. Vincent at thirty.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
The rendezvous, or central station
round which the main body was to revolve, and where, if
possible, it was always to be found, was changed from eight
leagues west of Ushant to "well in with Ushant in an easterly
wind." How the commander-in-chief understood this order
is shown by his instructions to his second in command,
when the fleet was for a time turned over to him. "I recommend
you in the strongest manner <i>never</i> to be farther
than six or eight leagues from Ushant with the wind easterly;
and if westerly to make the Saintes (Chaussée de
Sein) as often as the weather will permit; and when the
wind is such as to permit the French to slip out of Brest,
to stand in on the first of the flood so far as to see the inshore
squadron."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
In another letter to the same he says:
"The principle on which the squadron acts, with the wind
easterly, is to wear ... during the night, so as to be
within a couple of leagues of Ushant at daylight."
<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> So
constant was this practice during the summer and early
autumn months, while he himself remained on board, that
in one hundred and twenty-one days there was but one, and
then owing to fog, in which the main body did not communicate
by signal with the inshore squadron stationed
between Ushant and Brest.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>To sustain the ships in the greatest and most constant
efficiency, in other words to maintain the communications,
his care and watchfulness are incessant; and, though not
expressly so stated, it is evident from the general tenor of
his correspondence that the ships went in to refit and rest
not in large numbers, but singly, or in small groups. "I
am at my wits' end," he writes, "to compose orders to meet
every shift, evasion, and neglect of duty. Seven-eighths of
the captains who compose this fleet are practising every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
subterfuge to get into harbor for the winter."
<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> A constant
pressure is kept upon all officers of the fleet, and especially
upon those stationed to supervise at the anchorages for refittal
and taking in stores, that vessels should lose no time
and should come back as full as possible. The time for
remaining "in Plymouth Sound or Cawsand Bay <i>never</i>
ought to exceed six days, unless a mast is to be shifted,
and in that event not more than ten days."
<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> "A thousand
thanks are due you," he writes to Rear-Admiral Whitshed,
"for the pains you have taken to dispatch the ships which
were necessarily sent into Cawsand Bay. Without such
powerful aid, all my endeavors to fulfil the wishes of the
Cabinet would be vain."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> It was for this purpose he gave
the order, so bitterly resented, that no officer, from the
captain down, should sleep out of his ship, or go more than
three miles from the beach.</p>

<p>Throughout he strove, according to his own practice and
that of Suffren and Nelson,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> to make the ships self-dependent,
and to keep them out of the dockyards and on the
station to the last moment. "Under the present impending
storm from the North of Europe," wrote he in January,
1801, "and the necessity there is of equipping every ship in
the royal ports that can swim, no ship under my command
must have anything done to her at Plymouth or Portsmouth
that can be done at this anchorage."
<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The question of
wind and distance weighed heavily with him. Torbay
and Cawsand Bay, an anchorage in Plymouth Sound, were
made the ordinary resorts of ships going in to refit; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
his orders to the second in command, when left in charge
off Brest, were "on no occasion to authorize any ships to
go to Spithead, unless by special orders from the Admiralty
or from me." Finally, when his health compelled him to
abandon the immediate command afloat, he again, as at
Gibraltar during his Mediterranean career, took up his station
at the point of next importance to the efficiency of the
Brest fleet, settling himself in a house near Torbay, overlooking
the anchorage, whence he directly supervised the
refitting and speedy dispatch of the ships sent in for repair
and refreshment. In short, when unable to be with the
main body, he made a point of seeing personally to the
reserve and to the supplies.</p>

<p>To mass the fleet before Brest,—to maintain it in a high
state of efficiency, by the constant flow of supplies in
transports and the constant exchange between worn and
fresh ships,—and to fix a rendezvous which assured its
hold upon the enemy,—such were the strategic measures
adopted and enforced by St. Vincent. The disposition of
the ships when before the port, with a view to prevent the
evasion which was the height of French naval ambition,
and to compel the enemy to battle if he came out, may be
more properly called tactical. It may be given nearly in
his own words. "A squadron of five ships-of-the-line is
<i>always anchored</i> during an easterly wind between the Black
Rocks and Porquette Shoal" (about ten miles from the
entrance). "Inside, between them and the Goulet, cruise
a squadron of frigates and cutters plying day and night in
the opening of the Goulet; and outside, between the Black
Rocks and Ushant, three sail-of-the-line cruise to support
the five anchored."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
A group of eight line-of-battle ships
was thus always on the lookout,—a force too strong to be
driven off without bringing on the general engagement
which was the great object of the British, and so disposed
that, if not the inner, at least the outer members could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
signalled every day by the main body. The mutual support
of all parts of the fleet was thus assured. "Unless this
is done," wrote St. Vincent, "the ships appointed to that
important service may not feel the confidence necessary to
keep them in their post,—a failure in which has frequently
happened before I was invested with this command."
<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>The seamanlike care with which, as a general officer, he
studied his ground, is also evidenced by his remarks, some
of which have already been quoted. "I never was on a
station so readily, and with so little risk maintained as that
off Ushant with an easterly wind" (with which alone the
enemy could get out), "owing to the length and strength
of flood-tide;"<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
and he adds, in another place, "If the flood
flows strong, you will find <i>much shelter</i> between Ushant and
the Black Rocks during the day."
<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The investment of
Brest was completed by stationing detachments, amounting
in all to from two to four ships-of-the-line with numerous
frigates, to the southward of the Passage du Raz and
thence to Quiberon Bay, forming a chain of lookouts to intercept
vessels of all kinds, but especially the coasters upon
which the port depended for supplies; while other cruisers
were stationed all along the shores of the Bay of Biscay,
from the mouth of the Loire to Cape Finisterre, and their
captains specially incited and encouraged to approach and
scour the coast. In the various "cutting out" expeditions
engaged in by these, the numerous small vessels captured
are usually stated to have been loaded with stores for the
Brest fleet. By this means, if the enemy did not come out
and fight to break up the blockade, he must soon be reduced
to impotence by exhaustion of the commonest supplies. As
there were in Brest, in 1800, forty-eight ships-of-the-line,
French and Spanish, a combination resulting from Bruix's
cruise of the year before, this end was soon obtained, as
French accounts abundantly testify.
<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>The immediate adoption and enforcement of these measures,
after St. Vincent succeeded to the command, illustrate
clearly the inevitable dependence of the government upon
the admiral of the Channel fleet, and its inability to conceive
or enforce the system by which alone so necessary
yet hazardous a service could be effectually performed.
Only a thorough seaman, and of exceptional force of character,
could both devise and execute a scheme demanding
so much energy and involving so heavy a responsibility. It
was hard to find a man of St. Vincent's temper to carry
out his methods; and the government was further handicapped
by a tradition requiring a certain rank for certain
commands. So strong was the hold of this usage that even
St. Vincent, in 1801, yielded to it, lamenting that Nelson,
"of whom he felt quite sure, had not rank enough to take
the chief command" of the vitally important expedition to
Copenhagen; which was entrusted to Sir Hyde Parker, "of
whom he could not feel so sure, because he had never been
tried."<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
Later, when First Lord of the Admiralty, Earl St.
Vincent was fortunate enough to find in Admiral Cornwallis a
man who, whatever his intellectual grasp, possessed all the
nerve and tenacity of his predecessor; but the necessary rank
was too apt to bring with it a burden of years, accompanied
by the physical weakness which, in lesser men, led to failing
energy and shrinking from responsibility, and by actual
prostration drove even St. Vincent ashore in the winter
weather. His predecessor, Lord Bridport, had been well on
in the seventies, and his first successor, Sir Hyde Parker, announced
his intention "not to risk staying with the whole
fleet off Brest at this season [winter], when it blows hard

<a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>—a decision which may
have been no more than prudent, but the open avowal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
which, taken with Nelson's opinion of him,
<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> seems to show
that, though a brave and good officer, he was not equal to
the stern work demanded.</p>

<p>Lord St. Vincent, though perfectly satisfied with his own
arrangements, doubtless never cherished the vain hope that
no evasion of them could ever be practised. On the contrary,
he had at the very outset of his command, and in the
comparatively genial month of May, the experience of a
terrific hurricane, which drove his fleet headlong to Torbay,
and rejoiced the hearts of the cavilling adherents of the old
system. That the fleet must at times be blown off, he
knew full well; and also that the escape of the enemy, in
whole or in part, before its return, was possible, though it
ought not to be probable. To provide against this contingency,
he recommended the government to give to the officer
commanding the inshore squadron, who would remain,
special orders in a sealed packet to be opened only in case
the enemy got out.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
The failure to provide Colpoys with
such specific directions had been charged by the Opposition,
and most justly, as a grave fault of the government in
1796.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
It is right and wise to leave great discretion to the
officer in command on the spot,—minute instructions fetter
rather than guide him; but a man in Colpoys's situation,
bewildered as to the enemy's objects, aware only that
the first line of defence is forced, but ignorant where the
second will be assailed, is entitled to know precisely what
the government considers the most important among the
interests threatened. This decision is one for the statesman
rather than the seaman. Not only, in 1796, was Ireland
distinctly the most vulnerable point, but the ministers
had information, almost to certainty, that there was the
enemy's aim.</p>

<p>In 1800, as when Bruix escaped in 1799, circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
were somewhat different. The disaffection, or at least the
disloyalty, of the Irish had been shown to be a broken reed
for the enemy to lean on; while in the Mediterranean the
French had acquired, in Egypt and Malta, interests peculiarly
dear to the First Consul. Those valuable possessions
were in deadly straits, and the attempt to relieve them was
more probable than another attack on Ireland. St. Vincent,
therefore, wrote to the then head of the Admiralty,
saying with perfect propriety that it became him, "in the
situation I stand at this critical period, to suggest to your
lordship any ideas for the good of the public service," and
suggesting that Sir James Saumarez, commanding the inshore
squadron, should have specific orders that, "if the
combined fleets get out before I can return to the rendezvous,
he should in that case push for Cadiz with the eight
ships-of-the-line stationed between me and the Goulet; for
I," he added, "shall have sufficient force to protect England
and Ireland, without counting upon his eight sail." Such
instructions completed the scheme; precise, but not detailed,
they provided for the second line, in case the careful precautions
for guarding the first were foiled.</p>

<p>The dispositions adopted by St. Vincent remained the
standard to which subsequent arrangements for watching
Brest were conformed. From Commander-in-Chief of the
Channel fleet he became, in February, 1801, First Lord of
the Admiralty. In this position he naturally maintained
his own ideas; and, as has before been said, found in Cornwallis
a man admirably adapted to carry them out. In
May, 1804, the ministry with which he was connected resigned;
but, although as an administrator he provoked
grave criticism in many quarters, and probably lost reputation,
his distinguished military capacity remained unquestioned,
and the methods of the Brest blockade were too
sound in principle and too firmly established to be largely
modified. During the strenuous months from 1803 to 1805,
when Great Britain and France stood alone, face to face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
in a state more of watchful tension than of activity, the
Channel fleet kept its grip firm on the great French arsenal.
Nelson's justly lauded pursuit of Villeneuve would have
been in vain, but for the less known tenacity of Cornwallis;
which, by preventing the escape of Ganteaume, was one of
the most potent factors in thwarting Napoleon's combinations.
Wherever else the great naval battle which has
immortalized the name of Trafalgar might have been
fought, the campaign would have taken a different form
but for the watch over Brest conducted on St. Vincent's
lines.</p>

<p>The result of this strict blockade and of the constant
harrying of the French coasts from Dunkirk on the North
Sea to the Spanish border, was to paralyze Brest as a port
of naval equipment and construction, as well as to render
very doubtful the success of any combination in which the
Brest fleet was a factor. This result has been, historically,
somewhat obscured; for abortive attempts to get out obtained
no notoriety, while an occasional success, being
blazoned far and wide, made an impression disproportioned
to its real importance. When Ganteaume, for instance, in
January, 1801, ran out with seven ships-of-the-line,—the
blockading fleet having lost its grip in a furious north-east
gale,—more was thought of the escape than of the fact that,
to make it, advantage had to be taken of weather such that
six of the seven were so damaged they could not carry out
their mission. Instead of going to Egypt, they went to
Toulon. The journals of the day make passing mention of
occasional sorties of divisions, which quickly returned to
the anchorage; and Troude, in a few condensed sentences,
under the years 1800 and 1801,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> vividly shows the closeness
of the watch and the penury of the port. Remote from the
sources of naval supplies in the Baltic and the Mediterranean,
with the sea approaches to both swarming with enemy's
cruisers, and in a day when water carriage, always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
easier and ampler than that by land, was alone adequate
to the transport in sufficient quantity of the bulky articles
required for ship building and equipment, it became
impossible to fill the storehouses of Brest.</p>

<p>Partly for this reason, yet more because his keen military
perceptions—at fault only when confronted with the technical
difficulties of the sea—discerned the danger to Great
Britain from a hostile navy in the Scheldt, Napoleon decided
to neglect Brest, and to concentrate upon Antwerp
mainly his energies in creating a navy. In later years this
prepossession may have partaken somewhat of the partiality
of a parent for a child; and he himself has said that
there was a moment, during his receding fortunes in 1814,
when he could have accepted the terms of the allies had he
been able to bring himself to give up Antwerp. In close
proximity to the forests of Alsace, Lorraine, and Burgundy;
able to draw from the countries bordering on the Rhine
and its tributaries flax and hemp, and from the mines of
Luxemburg, Namur and Liège iron, copper and coal,—the
naval resources of Antwerp could be brought to her on the
numerous streams intersecting those countries, and were
wholly out of reach of the British. Many were the difficulties
to be overcome,—docks to be excavated, ships to be
built, seamen gathered and trained, a whole navy to be
created from nothing; but the truth remained that the
strategic position of Antwerp, over against the mouth of the
Thames and flanking the communications of Great Britain
with the Baltic, was unequalled by any other single port
under the emperor's control.</p>

<p>The expedition against Ireland, thwarted by the elements
in 1796, was never seriously renewed. It remained, to the
end of his short life, the dream of Hoche. Transferred
from the army of the Ocean to that of the Sambre and
Meuse, his career there was cut short by the preliminaries
of Leoben, by which Bonaparte extricated himself from the
dangers of his advance into Carinthia. Sacrificed thus, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
he felt, to the schemes of a rival, Hoche supported with all
the weight of his interest an expedition of fifteen thousand
men, who, under the pressure of the Directory, were
gathered in the Texel in the summer of 1797 for an invasion
of Ireland under convoy of the Dutch navy. Here
again Wolfe Tone for two months fretted his heart out,
waiting for the fleet to sail; but, though the period seemed
most propitious, through the mutinies in the British fleet
and the cessation of hostilities on the continent, a peculiar
combination of wind and tide were wanting to cross the bar,
and that combination did not come. In October the Dutch
ships-of-war, numbering sixteen small ships-of-the-line, put
to sea by themselves, and on the 11th met the fleet of Admiral
Duncan, of equal numbers but distinctly superior in broadside
force. The British, having the wind, bore down and
attacked—passing when possible through the enemy's line,
so as to cut off his retreat to the Dutch coast, then less than
ten miles distant. The battle, known by the name of
Camperdown, from a village on the adjoining shore, was
fought with all the desperation that in every age has marked
the meetings of the British and the Dutch. It closed with
the defeat of the latter, who left nine ships-of-the-line and
some frigates in their enemy's hands. This put an end
to the Texel expedition. Hoche had died a few weeks before,
on the 18th of September; and with him passed away
the strongest personal interest in the invasion of Ireland,
as well as the man most able to conduct it.</p>

<p>The following year, 1798, open rebellion existed in Ireland,
and the Directory undertook to support it with troops
and arms; but the equipment of Bonaparte's Egyptian expedition
absorbed the energies of the Ministry of Marine,
and there was no Hoche to give the enterprise the development
and concert essential to a great success. A small
division of four frigates sailed from Rochefort on the 6th
of August, carrying twelve hundred troops under General
Humbert, who had served in the expedition of 1796 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
shared the shipwreck of the Droits de l'Homme. This
squadron escaped observation, landed its detachment on
the 21st of the month, and returned safely to France; but
the small corps, unsupported by regular troops, again demonstrated
the imprudence of trusting to the co-operation
of insurgents. On the 8th of September Humbert was
obliged to surrender with the bulk of his force.</p>

<p>A week later, before the news reached France, a ship-of-the-line,
appropriately called the "Hoche," and eight frigates,
under the command of Commodore Bompart, sailed from
Brest, carrying a second division of three thousand troops.
Though they escaped the eyes of Bridport's vessels, if there
were any in the neighborhood, by running through the Passage
du Raz, they were seen on September 17, the day after
sailing, by three British frigates; one of which, after ascertaining
that the French were really going to sea, went to
England with the news, while the others continued to dog
the enemy, sending word to Ireland of the approaching
danger as opportunity offered. On the 4th of October, in
a gale of wind, the enemies separated, and the French commodore
then made the best of his way towards his destination,
in Lough Swilly, at the north end of Ireland; but the
news had reached Plymouth on the 23d of September, and
when he drew near his port he found the way blocked by
three British ships-of-the-line and five frigates, which had
sailed at once for the insurgent district. An engagement
followed, fought on the 12th of October, under circumstances
even more disadvantageous than that of mere numbers,
for the "Hoche" shortly before the action had lost some
of her most important spars. Of the little squadron, she
and three frigates were compelled to surrender that day,
and three more were intercepted later by British vessels,
so that only two of the expedition regained a French port.
The enthusiastic and unfortunate Irishman, Wolfe Tone,
was on board the "Hoche" and wounded in the action.
He shortly afterwards committed suicide in prison. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
third French division had sailed from Rochefort on the
very day the "Hoche" was captured. It succeeded in
reaching Ireland; but learning the fate of Bompart's squadron,
returned without landing the troops. This was the
last of the expeditions against Ireland that sailed from
French ports. Other interests and other rulers combined
with the pronounced naval ascendency of Great Britain to
give a different direction to the efforts of the republic.</p>

The word <i>entretenu</i>, here rendered "paid," is difficult to translate. The
dictionary of the French Academy explains it to mean an officer kept on pay,
without necessarily being employed. Littré says that an officer "non entretenu"
is one not having a commission. The word carries the idea of permanence.
By the decree of April 28, "enseignes non entretenus" had no pay
nor military authority, except when on military service; nor could they wear
the uniform, except when so employed.</p></div>

For example, that any captain surrendering to a force less than double
his own should suffer death; and if of a ship-of-the-line, to any number of
enemies unless the vessel was actually sinking. The same fate awaited
him who, in a fleet action, allowed the line to be broken. So also the
decree not to give quarter. See Chevalier, Mar. Fran. sous la Rép., p. 128;

The Peninsular War, so brilliant in many of its features and in the end
so triumphantly successful, has some analogies to the smaller expeditions
here criticised, and may be thought to refute the remarks in the text. The
analogy, however, fails in some very decisive points. The landing and base
of operations at Lisbon were in the territory of an ally of long standing; the
projected advance was into a country in general insurrection against foreign
rule; above all, the position of Lisbon and its distance from France imposed
upon the French, in case they advanced against it in great force as they
did in 1810, a long and very difficult line of communication, while the
British had the sea open. Toulon, in 1793, was disadvantageous to the
British as compared with Lisbon in 1809, because farther from England
and in France. For remarks on Peninsular War see

The author is keenly aware that this policy, of garrisoning several somewhat
separated ports, is seemingly inconsistent with sound military principles
as to concentration, as well as with what he himself has elsewhere said about
the proper dispositions for maintaining military control of a maritime region.
It is, therefore, well to explain that those principles and dispositions apply
where the belligerent navies are so far equal as to create a real struggle.
This was not the case in the French Revolution. Great Britain had undisputed
naval supremacy in the West Indies, and the question before her was,
not to beat the enemy's fleet, but to secure her own commercial routes. To this
end it was necessary to disseminate, not concentrate her ships, and to provide
them with convenient centres of refuge and supply along the routes. The
case was analogous to the police arrangements of a city. In ordinary quiet
times the police are distributed to cope with individual offenders; when a
mob gathers and threatens the peace they are concentrated in large bodies.</p></div>

A ship is said to be hove-to when some of the sails are so arranged
as to move her ahead and others to force her astern,—the result being that
she remains nearly in the same spot, but drifts slowly to leeward.</p></div>

A raking shot is one that passes from end to end, lengthwise, of a ship,
instead of across, from side to side. It not only ranges through a greater
space within, but attacks more vital parts, particularly about the stern, where
were the rudder and the more important officers of a ship.</p></div>

Another advantage in engaging to leeward was that the lower-deck
batteries, which contained the heaviest guns, were so near the water that a
ship heeling over with a strong breeze could not always open her lee ports.
The lee ship of two opponents, using her weather guns, would escape this
inconvenience and have a proportionate advantage. On the First of June
the weather was too moderate to affect the use of the lower-deck batteries;
but on the 29th of May, the "Queen Charlotte," using her lee as well as her
weather guns as she broke through the French line, had the lower deck full
of water. One of her officers, Lieutenant (afterwards Admiral) Codrington,
being knocked down by the recoil of a gun and thrown to the lee side of the
deck, could, when leaning on his left arm, barely keep his head out of water.

A whimsical incident is told as occurring in this grim scene of slaughter
and destruction. "The 'Brunswick' had a large figurehead of the Duke, with
a laced hat on. The hat was struck off by a shot during the battle. The crew
of the ship sent a deputation to the quarter-deck to request that Captain Harvey
would be pleased to order his servant to give them his laced cocked-hat
to supply the loss. The captain, with great good-humor, complied, and the
carpenter nailed it on the Duke's head, where it remained till the battle was
finished." (Barrow's Life of Howe.)</p></div>

The speech of Barrère in the National Convention was as follows: "Imagine
the 'Vengeur' ship-of-the-line pierced with cannon shot, opening in
all directions, and surrounded by English tigers and leopards, a crew composed
of wounded and dying men, battling against the waves and the cannon.
All at once the tumult of the action, the fear of danger, the pain-stricken
cries of the wounded cease; all mount or are carried upon deck. Every flag,
every pennant is hoisted. Cries of 'Vive la République!' 'Vive la Liberté
et la France!' are heard on all sides; it is the touching and animated spectacle
of a civic festival, rather than the terrible moment of a shipwreck. For a
moment they must have thought upon their fate. But no, citizens, our
brothers thought no more upon that, they see only the English and their
country. They choose rather to be engulfed than to dishonor her by a surrender.
They hesitate not an instant. Their last prayers are for liberty and
for the Republic. They disappear."</p></div>

The French accounts state that he remained until eight <span class="sc">P.M</span>.,
during all
which time he might have been attacked. The English on the contrary say
that the whole French fleet was out of sight by quarter past six. The question
is not material, for it is certain that Villaret did remain for some time,
and that he would not have been attacked had he stayed longer.</p></div>

The carelessness with which naval affairs are too often described by
general historians may be illustrated by the account of this battle given by
one of the most distinguished. "Lord Howe gained so decisive a success
from the adoption of the same principles which gave victory to Frederic at
Leuthen, to Napoleon at Austerlitz, and to Wellington at Salamanca, viz.:
<i>to direct an overwhelming force against one half of the enemy's force</i>, and making
the attack obliquely, keeping the weather gage of the enemy, to render it
impossible for the ships to leeward to work up to the assistance of those engaged.
By this means he reduced one half of the enemy's fleet to be the passive
spectators of the destruction of the other.... Had he succeeded <i>in penetrating
the line at all points</i>, or had his captains implicitly obeyed his directions
in that particular, and engaged the whole to leeward, he would have brought
twenty ships-of-the-line to Spithead." (Alison's "History of Europe.") How
an attack upon one half of the line is consistent with penetrating the same
line at all points does not clearly appear; but the statement concerning
Lord Howe's principle of action on the 1st of June is absolutely contrary to
all the facts, although Alison had James's painstaking work before him and
refers to it frequently. His statement is that of Jomini's "Guerres de la
Révolution Française;" but the latter author writes only as a military man,
introduces naval matters merely incidentally, and was doubtless misled in the
scanty information attainable when he wrote.</p></div>

It is a curious coincidence, though not necessarily significant, that the
number of men hit in each of these ships was nearly the same. The "Royal
Sovereign" lost fifty-four, the "Queen" fifty-four, and the "Glory" fifty-two.</p></div>

Brenton, in his naval history of Great Britain, tells an amusing story of
the captain of one of the ships a little to Howe's left, which at once characterizes
a type of officer and illustrates the above remark. He was, Brenton
says, so occupied with preserving his station by the azimuth compass that he
lost sight of his intended antagonist, and in the smoke never found him.</p></div>

Many years later Admiral Villaret was governor of Martinique. When
that island was taken by the British in 1809, he went to England as a passenger
in a ship commanded by Capt. E. P. Brenton. This officer in his
naval history states that Villaret told him that Robespierre's orders were to
go to sea, and that, if the convoy fell into Howe's hands, his head should answer
for it. Therefore he avoided action so long, and endeavored to draw
Lord Howe out of the track of the convoy. The loss of the ships taken was
to him a matter of comparative indifference. "While your admiral amused
himself refitting them, I saved my convoy, and I saved my head."</p></div>

of disapprobation too profound for reproach:—
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,—I have received and communicated to my Lords
Commissioners of
the Admiralty your letter to me of the 29th December, giving an account of
your proceedings and of the severe [several?] occurrences which have taken
place during your passage from Gibraltar, with the squadron under your command;
and I have their Lordships' commands to acquaint you that they cannot
but feel the greatest regret that you should have been induced to return
to England with the squadron under your orders, under the circumstances in
which you were placed.
</p>
<p>
I have their Lordships' further commands to acquaint you that orders will
be to sent to you, either by this or to-morrow's post, to strike your flag and
come on shore.</p>

An exciting incident occurred during this chase. In the height of it a
man fell overboard. A boat was lowered and picked him up; but the
enemy's ships were so close it became doubtful whether the British frigate
could afford to await her return. Nelson, always generous to the verge of
rashness, backed a topsail, saying "I won't let Hardy go," and succeeded in
carrying him off. The anecdote gains in interest when it is remembered that
Hardy, who was taken in the prize of December 20, had just been released
from Spain; and that, as captain of the flag-ship at Trafalgar, he was witness
of Nelson's fall and death-scene.</p></div>

A favorite project with the Directory, as with Napoleon, was to mass the
French and Spanish navies in one great body; as had several times been
done under Louis XVI. during the American Revolution. Such a combination
was hoped for the Irish expedition of 1796; and, though too late for
that purpose, the movement from Cartagena to Cadiz was regarded by the
Directory as a step toward uniting the fleets. This was one of the objects of
Bruix's adventurous sortie from Brest in 1799, when he actually brought
back to that port in his train fifteen Spanish ships,—nominal allies, actual
hostages. The combination at Trafalgar is well known. Later on the Emperor
sought to build up a patch-work fleet out of all the minor navies of the
Continent, as he pieced together out of all the nations the immense army
which was swallowed up in his Russian enterprise. But here, as usually,
a homogeneous body, centrally placed, triumphed over an incongruous
coalition.</p></div>

The stringent exactions of the close-hauled line-of-battle imposed upon
a fleet, in the presence of an enemy, the tactical necessity of rectifying the
order with any considerable change of wind,—an evolution whose difficulty
increased in direct proportion to the number of the ships; and in a more
than geometrical progression, when they were badly drilled.</p></div>

James states that these ships first came to the wind on the starboard
tack, heading as did the British, "as if intending to weather the whole British
fleet." The superior speed and weatherliness of the Spanish ships, if well
handled, might have enabled them very seriously to molest the British in
their attack; but, from the whole conduct of the Spaniards on this day, it is
probable that the movement, if made, was only one of the successive vacillations
of men who had put themselves in a false position. (Vol. ii. p. 39.)</p></div>

"When the 'Prince George' tacked, the two three-deckers [of the Spanish
lee division] tacked after us, and which the rest of the enemy's rear were
about to do; but the commander-in-chief, with the ships of [our] centre and
rear, following close, <i>covered us from their attack upon the rear of the ships
with me</i>, and obliged them to re-tack ... and effectually divided the enemy's
fleet." (Sir William Parker's narrative of the conduct of the British van. Nelson's
Dispatches, vol. ii. p. 473.) The gallant admiral's style is confused, but
his meaning is clear enough after half a dozen readings. He must not be
taken for the very distinguished officer of the same name, but of the next
generation.
</p>
<p>
Both Parker and Nelson (Dispatches, vol. ii. pp. 340, 344) speak of the
main Spanish division as "the van." In truth, when the "Culloden" interposed,
the whole enemy's fleet were so nearly joined on the port tack as to
seem in line, though disorderly and not quite connected.</p></div>

"Upon reaching Venice, Commodore, you will call, in company with the
commanding general and the Minister of France, on the provisional government.
You will tell them that the conformity of principles existing between
the French and Venetian republics, and the protection granted by us to them,
exact the prompt equipment of their navy, in order to concert with us, to
maintain the mastery of the Adriatic and the islands; that for this purpose I
have sent troops to Corfu, to preserve it to the Venetian Republic; and that
henceforth it is necessary to work actively to put their navy in good condition.

This statement is based on the plate in the "Commentaires de Napoléon,"
vol. ii. p. 190. There are evident inaccuracies in the British positions
there given (<i>e.g.</i>, for June 22, and in the approach to Alexandria); but that
of the 25th seems probable. James states that on the night of June 22 the
tracks of the two fleets crossed, but at a sufficient interval of time to prevent
a meeting,—the more so as a constant haze prevailed. (Nav. Hist., vol. ii.
p. 177.)</p></div>

In a chart of the old port of Alexandria, made in 1802 by Major Bryce
of the Royal Engineers, attached to Abercromby's expedition, it is said that
not less than five fathoms will be found throughout the middle passage. The
directions add that heavy ships cannot get out unless with good weather for
warping. This was Brueys's great objection to entering, and it was well
taken; but the alternative of destruction was worse.</p></div>

A spring is a rope taken from the stern of a ship at anchor and fastened
either to the riding cable or to an anchor suitably placed, so as to turn the
broadside in the direction wished. Owing to the boats being away to get
water when Nelson appeared, to the failure of many of them to return, and to
the rapidity with which the attack was made, these precautions were not
carried out.</p></div>

Letter of Brueys to Bonaparte, July 13, 1798; La Gravière, Guerres
Maritimes, vol. i. p. 367. This is a somewhat singular example of following
a rule, the principle of which is not grasped. The rear of a column of sailing
ships under way was the weaker end, because less easily helped by the van;
but in a column of ships at anchor, head to wind, the weather ships were incomparably
more exposed, the lee having a very hard pull to get up to them.</p></div>

Until after the middle of this century there were in the British navy
three flags of the same general design, but with red, white, and blue grounds.
Admirals were divided into three classes, of the Red, the White, and the Blue;
and, according to their classification, ships under their immediate command
showed the corresponding ensign. Nelson being at this time a rear-admiral
of the Blue, his ships would usually carry the blue flag, almost invisible
at night.
</p>
<p>
At the present day all British naval vessels wear the white flag, and merchant
ships the red.</p></div>

The first attack of the thirteen British ships (counting among them the
"Leander," fifty,) was confined to the eight head ships of the French line, down
to and including the "Tonnant." As these were one by one crushed, the British
dropped down and engaged those in the rear,—but with a vigor necessarily
diminished by the injuries they had themselves received, not to speak of the
physical fatigue induced by the labor and excitement of the previous hours.
Nevertheless the "Mercure," when she hauled down her flag, had lost one hundred
and five killed and one hundred and forty-eight wounded, and had but
six guns that could be used. The loss of the "Heureux" is not stated, but she
had nine feet of water in her hold. (Chevalier, Mar. Fran. sous la Rép., pp.
376, 377.)</p></div>

The American novelist and naval historian, Fenimore Cooper, in the
preface to the "Two Admirals," has attributed the whole tactical combination
to the captains, on the authority of Captain Ball of the "Alexander,"
speaking to the late Commodore Morris of the United States Navy, who in
turn was Cooper's informant. This constitutes a perfectly respectable oral
tradition, coming through intelligent men of unquestioned integrity; but
when opposed to the contemporary written statement of Captain Berry, Nelson's
flag-captain, who had the fullest opportunity of knowing the facts, it becomes
impossible to doubt that somewhere in the chain of witnesses there has
been a misunderstanding. That Captain Foley conceived on the moment the
plan he executed is perfectly credible; but that the whole body of captains
were inspired to carry out, as by mutual consent, a combination of which
there had been no previous mention, is a marvel of which Berry's account of
Nelson's constant discussions and explanations with his officers effectually
disposes. (See Narrative of an Officer of Rank, etc. Naval Chronicle, vol. i.
p. 52.)</p></div>

The roadstead of Aboukir is not safe in winter. It can protect a
squadron during the summer. (Commentaires de Nap., vol. ii. p. 235.) In Abercromby's
expedition, 1801, "all the pilots accustomed to the Egyptian coast
declared that till after the equinox it would be madness to attempt a landing."
(Sir R. Wilson's History of British Expedition to Egypt, 2d edition, p. 6.)
The fleet then lay in Aboukir Bay from March 2 to March 8, before landing
could be made.</p></div>

The opinion of a French officer may be worth quoting. "Although
every one knows what he is, I will nevertheless say a word about Sir Sidney
Smith. He has something at once of the knight and of the charlatan. A
man of intelligence, yet bordering upon insanity, with the ability of a leader,
he has thought to honor his career by often running absurd risks, without
any useful end, but only to be talked about. Every one ridicules him, and
justly; for in the long run he is wearisome, though very original." (Mémoires
du Duc de Raguse (Marmont), vol. ii. p. 30.)</p></div>

"The siege of Acre lasted sixty-two days. There were two periods.
The first from March 19 to April 25, thirty-six days, during which the
artillery of the besiegers consisted of two carronades, 32 and 24 pound, taken
from British boats, and thirty-six field guns. The second period was from
April 25 to May 21, twenty-six days." (Commentaires de Napoléon, vol. iii.,
p. 63.) "During the latter period the park was increased by two 24-, and
four 18-pounders." (Ibid, p. 82.)</p></div>

Commentaires de Napoléon, vol. iii. pp. 81, 82. It is only fair to say
that an attempt was made by Perrée a few weeks later to land ammunition
back of Mt. Carmel, when he was discovered and chased off. (Barrow's Life
of Sir Sidney Smith, vol. i. p. 300.) Napoleon may have confused the two
circumstances. His own correspondence (vol. v., pp. 517, 518) contradicts the
landing near Acre. The guns were put on shore at Jaffa and thence dragged
to Acre.</p></div>

"Admiral Bruix, being able to rely more on the devotion of his captains
than upon their exactitude and precision in manœuvring, took pains before
sailing to lay down the duties of a captain under all circumstances; carefully
refraining, however, from making a special application of these lessons to
any one individual, that their self-love might not be wounded. This wise precaution
did not prevent new mistakes, whose consequences would have been
much aggravated had we been obliged, by meeting the enemy, to manœuvre
either to avoid or compel action." (Journal of Captain Moras, special aide-de-camp
to Admiral Bruix. La Gravière, Guerres Maritimes, vol. i. p. 373.
Appendix, 4th edition.)
</p>
<p>
The gunnery, apparently, was equally bad. "I will cite only one fact to
give an idea of the effects of our artillery. When Admiral Bruix was bringing
to Brest the French and Spanish fleets, at least nine hundred guns were
fired in very fine weather at an Algerian corsair without doing any harm. I
do not believe that ever, in a combat of that kind, was so much useless firing
done." (Article by "an officer of marine artillery;" Moniteur, 3 Fructidor,
An 8 [Aug. 20, 1800].)</p></div>

Bruix did not have over a thousand troops with him, the pressure on the
land frontiers by the Second Coalition demanding all the force that could be
raised to resist it; but the fleet carried twenty-four thousand seamen or artillerists,
a force capable by itself of accomplishing much. The reputation of
the admiral caused both officers and men to flock to his flag.</p></div>

Lord Keith's biographer (Allardyce) says he determined "to take
Minorca on his way to Rosas" (p. 165); which was certainly a liberal construction,
though not beyond the discretion of an officer in Keith's position.
To take Minorca on his way to Rosas, from his position on the 8th, was to go
two hundred miles to the former and one hundred and fifty more to Rosas,
when the latter at the moment was not two hundred distant. He was a few
miles nearer Rosas than Minorca, when he took the decision which finally
wrecked the cruise.</p></div>

To this must be added that, from conditions of wind and weather, Malta
was very far from Toulon, much farther than Toulon from Malta. Of this
Nelson complained often and bitterly in the later war, when commander-in-chief
off Toulon. Malta was valuable, he said (Disp., vol. v. p. 107), as a most
important outwork to India and for influence in the Levant; valueless against
Toulon.</p></div>

"At the theatre last night I had a conversation with General Kilmaine
[commanding the division intended to send into Ireland]. He told me
... the arsenals at Brest are empty; and what stores they have in other
ports they cannot convey thither, from the superiority of the naval force of the
enemy, which kept everything blocked up." (Wolf Tone's Journal, June 16,
1798.) In 1801 "the port of Brest lacked provisions. The difficulty of getting
the convoys into it decided the First Consul to break up the fleet there and
send part to Rochefort.... The Spanish admiral (who had come there with
Bruix in 1799) was invited to escort the division. To equip the necessary
ships, this officer had to give them equipments taken from the others of his
squadron, and could obtain provisions only for seventeen days. Baffled by
the winds and by the constant presence of the enemy, the ships did not sail."
A combined expedition against the Cape of Good Hope failed for the same
reason. "The blockade of the Dutch ports was no less rigorous than that of
the coast of France." "At Brest, they lived from day to day. Villaret Joyeuse

There is between Ushant and the reefs a narrow passage, practicable for
ships-of-the-line, which was surveyed under Lord St. Vincent; but it could
only be used with pilots, and was rather a convenience than an important
feature.</p></div>

In the English Channel and the neighboring western coasts of Europe,
winds from S.W. to N.W. prevail during three fourths of the days of the year,
and are often exceedingly violent.</p></div>

See "Twelve letters to the Rt. Hon. Spencer Perceval," by Capt. James
Manderson, 1812; in which it is also said that Mr. Pitt was towards the end of
his life much impressed with the advantages of Falmouth's position. To this
opinion is probably due the following statement in a magazine of the day,
during Pitt's short second administration: "It is now (Feb. 1805) determined
that the Channel fleet shall in future rendezvous at Falmouth, and moorings
are immediately to be laid down for fifteen sail-of-the-line." (Nav. Chron.,
vol. xiii. p. 328.) Lord Exmouth seems to have shared this opinion. (Life,
p. 140.) While Falmouth was by position admirably suited for a rendezvous,
ships running for refuge to Torbay would have the wind three points more
free, an advantage seamen will appreciate.</p></div>

Bouvet was broken without trial by the Directory on the 15th of
February, 1797, and was not restored to the navy until 1801, under the Consulate.
Captain Chevalier's judgment is that "he despaired too soon of the
success of the expedition, ... and forgot that he should have been inspired
only by the great interests entrusted by accident to his hands." (Mar.
Fran. sous la Rép., pp. 309, 311.)</p></div>

Tucker, vol. ii. p. 121. Modern ships, so much more complex, are much
more liable to derangement than those of St. Vincent; and, unless such pains
as his are taken to make them self-sufficing, their officers and the dockyards
will make a heavier drain on the force of the fleet than in his day. Perhaps
in no point will provident administration more affect the efficiency of the fleet
than in this.</p></div>

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
